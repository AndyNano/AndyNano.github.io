defined our civilization. Today, \u000d\u000awe call our civilization the Silicon Age due to our large consumption of silicon in electrical \u000d\u000acomponents. Materials Science is therefore an incredibly important research field with a major role \u000d\u000ain the development of our civilization. \u000d\u000a For millenaries, the way we have designed new materials has been through the trial-and-error\u000d\u000aapproach. However, with the high demands of modern society, we need to develop new and functional \u000d\u000amaterials faster than ever. Therefore, we must understand the properties governed by materials and \u000d\u000ahow to synthesize materials with specific properties. We call this synthesis by design. \u000d\u000a For the last century, we have been able to characterize the structure of crystalline materials using\u000d\u000acrystallography but to do synthesis by design, we must also understand how materials form. Often,\u000d\u000athe formation of materials goes through a chemical phase where nanoclusters are present in solution. \u000d\u000aThe structure of nanoclusters in solution cannot be characterized with conventional crystallographic \u000d\u000amethods and hence, this part of the material formation is poorly understood. In the last decades, it has \u000d\u000abeen shown that total scattering with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) can be used to describe the \u000d\u000aatomic arrangements of nanoclusters in solution and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) can be \u000d\u000aused to describe the shape and size distribution of the nanoclusters. However, modelling of PDF and \u000d\u000aSAXS have been restricted to expert users and rarely a combination of PDF and SAXS has been used. \u000d\u000aIn this Master Thesis, we push the boundaries of PDF and SAXS analysis. It is demonstrated how we \u000d\u000acan combine the information from PDF and SAXS to get a better understanding of nanoclusters in \u000d\u000asolution. Specifically, we focus on the formation of the [Bi38O45] cluster by dissolving crystalline\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O in dimethylsulfoxid. Furthermore, we show that automated modelling of \u000d\u000aPDF and SAXS data can provide new insight compared to conventional modelling techniques, and \u000d\u000apotentially automated modelling can make PDF and SAXS analysis accessible for non-expert users. ","2\u000d\u000a1 Introduction\u000d\u000aAtomically precise nanoclusters have in recent years been massively investigated since the ability to \u000d\u000asynthetically control the nanocluster sizes1, 2 3 4-7 brings along the ability to reach a range of \u000d\u000aapplications with tuned properties.8-12 13, 14 15, 16 4, 16 3 Thereby atomically precise nanoclusters serve as \u000d\u000aan excellent model system for growth mechanisms and many of the nanoclusters can undergo \u000d\u000anucleation to form materials.\u000d\u000a3, 17 Developing new materials have in the past millenaries been done\u000d\u000ausing the trial-and-error approach. However, if we want to follow the high demand of superior \u000d\u000amaterials by modern society, we must be able to construct materials with specific properties by \u000d\u000adesign. Developing new and functional materials by design is dependent on a thorough understanding \u000d\u000aof the growth mechanism or nucleation reaction. Despite that, the challenge of understanding growth \u000d\u000amechanisms and nucleation reactions at an atomic scale is still an open problem in inorganic- and \u000d\u000amaterials chemistry.18 Total Scattering (TS) with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis is now \u000d\u000awidely used as a method for characterizing materials without long-range order, such as \u000d\u000ananomaterials,19, 20 disordered materials21, 22 or amorphous materials,23 where conventional \u000d\u000acrystallographic approaches fail.24-26 For small, non-periodic objects, e.g., nanoclusters, structure \u000d\u000amodelling in either reciprocal (Q) or real (r) space can be done by employing the Debye-equation for \u000d\u000acalculation of scattering intensities, where the position of each atom in the structure is taken into \u000d\u000aaccount:\u000d\u000aEquation 1.1 \ud835(\ud835) = &&\ud835!(\ud835) \u2219 \ud835\"(\ud835) \u2219\u000d\u000asin (\ud835 \u2219 \ud835!\")\u000d\u000a\ud835 \u2219 \ud835!\"\u000d\u000a#\u000d\u000a\"$%\u000d\u000a#\u000d\u000a!$%\u000d\u000aHere, rij is the distance between atom i and j, and f is the atomic scattering factor. The Debye Equation \u000d\u000acan be applied for both small-angle and wide-angle scattering data (SAXS/WAXS), and a Debye \u000d\u000aanalysis can be done either in reciprocal-space, or real-space by PDF modelling after Fourier \u000d\u000atransformation of calculated scattering intensities.27, 28 While the use of the Debye scattering equation \u000d\u000ais computationally expensive, it can be used to calculate the scattering pattern of any structure. In \u000d\u000arecent years, the Debye scattering equation has been applied in PDF analysis of e.g. local structural \u000d\u000amotifs in amorphous materials,22, 29 metallic nanoclusters,28, 30, 31 understanding nucleation processes \u000d\u000afrom ionic metal oxido nanoclusters in solution32 and growth mechanisms of ionic metal oxido \u000d\u000ananoclusters in solution.33, 34 In these studies, a scattering pattern or PDF from a model structure is \u000d\u000acalculated using the Debye equation, and variables such as atomic positions and atomic displacement \u000d\u000aparameters (ADPs) may be refined, until a good fit with the data is obtained. We will demonstrate ","3\u000d\u000ahow this approach can be used to follow the cluster growth from [Bi6O8] to [Bi38O45] using in situ\u000d\u000aPDF and SAXS analysis of data measured on crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O dissolved in \u000d\u000adimethylsulfoxid. This is a cumbersome process that often is restricted to experts in the field.\u000d\u000a Fortunately, automated methods such as structure-mining and cluster-mining have recently \u000d\u000aappeared to overcome this challenge.30, 35, 36 In a recent study of amorphous molybdenum oxide \u000d\u000amaterials, Christiansen et al. introduced a new approach, where they automatically generated a large \u000d\u000anumber of MoOx clusters to fit experimental data to identify dominating structural motifs in the \u000d\u000asample.22 I will refer to this approach as the automated motif extractor. They hypothesized that the \u000d\u000astructural motifs present in amorphous molybdenum oxides can also be found in well-known \u000d\u000acrystalline structures, and they therefore used crystal structures of molybdenum oxides as starting \u000d\u000amodels, from which they could cut out thousands of different cluster structure models of different \u000d\u000asizes, which were all tested against their data. However, both the structure-mining, cluster-mining \u000d\u000aand the automated motif extractor approach require extensive computational power since they are \u000d\u000abased on fits of the data, using minimization methods as least-squares algorithm, to a large number\u000d\u000aof structural models. Ideally, we want automated structure characterization in seconds such that the \u000d\u000aresults can be used directly to effectively adjust the experiments while performing them. Lately, \u000d\u000aMachine Learning (ML) has both been used to model PDF data by predicting the space group of a \u000d\u000astructure from the PDF37 and to predict the atomic coordinates of a mono-metallic cluster.36 ML is \u000d\u000asignificantly faster than minimization techniques and often the prediction is instant.\u000d\u000a Here, we introduce two new approaches of automated modelling, which are both based on ML. The \u000d\u000afirst approach uses simulated data of polyoxometalate (POM) clusters to train a ML model to classify \u000d\u000awhich POM structure a PDF is from. The other approach is a further development of the automated \u000d\u000amotif extractor. We use machine learning (ML) to evaluate the results from automated motif extractor\u000d\u000ato identify important structural motifs. Machine Learning based Motif Extractor (ML-MotEx)\u000d\u000aextracts hundreds or thousands of structural models from chosen starting structure, and then fit these\u000d\u000aindividual models to a dataset. The structures and the goodness-of-fit parameter, Rwp value, from each \u000d\u000afit are handed to an ML algorithm which learns how to predict Rwp values based on a structure (A \u000d\u000adescription of the Rwp value is given in Appendix III). The ML algorithm is subsequently analysed \u000d\u000awith the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values,\u000d\u000a38 which provide a measure of how \u000d\u000aimportant each structural feature is to the prediction of the goodness-of-fit value. The ML-MotEx\u000d\u000aalgorithm outputs quantified values of how important each atom in a model is for the structure to \u000d\u000ayield a low Rwp value in the given fitting algorithm. Both ML procedures presented in this Master \u000d\u000aThesis are done completely automated, in semi-real experimental time and without human bias. It is \u000d\u000athereby a step towards high-throughput real-time automated analysis of PDF analysis.","4\u000d\u000a2 Using Scattering to Characterise the \u000d\u000aNanocluster Structure: A \u2018Complex\u2019 Problem\u000d\u000a2.1 Introduction\u000d\u000aAs stated in Chapter 1, it is important to resolve the structure of nanoclusters at an atomic level to \u000d\u000aunderstand cluster growth and nucleation processes with the overall goal of doing synthesis of new \u000d\u000aand functional materials by design. The Debye equation has recently been used with PDF and SAXS \u000d\u000aanalysis in both reciprocal-space and real-space to elucidate the structure of nanoclusters in \u000d\u000asolution.28, 30, 32 This Chapter introduces the scattering theory behind the Debye Equation. The \u000d\u000astrengths and weaknesses are discussed of presenting Debye scattering data in either reciprocal- or \u000d\u000areal-space. It is illustrated that some structures are too complex to be characterized by a single \u000d\u000atechnique alone but by applying data from multiple techniques, the structure can be characterized.\u000d\u000a2.2 Scattering from an Electron to a Material\u000d\u000aScattering from an Electron\u000d\u000aScattering is a well-known phenomenon that is happening all around us. For example, light scattering \u000d\u000ais accountable for the color of the blue sky due to the scattering of sunlight from the water droplets\u000d\u000aand it is accountable for the white color of milk due to scattering of light from colloidals in \u000d\u000asuspension. For materials chemists, scattering has been an exceptionally important tool to characterise \u000d\u000athe structure of materials. However, materials chemists do not only use light scattering to characterize \u000d\u000athe structure of materials. Material chemists utilize a range of scattering phenomena as light, electron, \u000d\u000aneutron and X-ray scattering. In this section, we will focus on X-ray scattering, however, the \u000d\u000aprinciples of X-ray scattering are very similar to those of electron and neutron scattering.\u000d\u000a From X-ray scattering with in-house equipment to synchrotrons, all build on the interaction between \u000d\u000aX-ray and the electron cloud. We will start by considering the scattering of X-rays from a single \u000d\u000aelectron as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The oscillating electromagnetic wave, X-ray, induces an \u000d\u000aoscillation of the electron, hence an acceleration. From fundamental electromagnetic theory, it is \u000d\u000aknown that accelerated charged particles emit electromagnetic waves. Therefore, the electron will \u000d\u000aemit X-rays. The outgoing X-ray wave of the electron will have a spherical propagation with a phase \u000d\u000ashift of \u03c0 to the incoming X-ray wave.\u000d\u000a39-41","5\u000d\u000aFigure 2.1: The incoming wave, ki, is scattered from the electron as outgoing wave kf. The change in \u000d\u000awavevectors, kf \u2013 ki, is referred to as the scattering vector, Q.\u000d\u000aAs seen in Figure 2.1 the scattering process can be described by the scattering vector, Q, which is the \u000d\u000adifference of the incident X-ray beam ki and the scattered X-ray beam, kf. During a scattering event, \u000d\u000atwo types of scattering occur: elastic and inelastic scattering. The illustrated process, where the size \u000d\u000aof ki and kf is the same, is only valid for elastic coherent scattering i.e., where the energy of the Xray beam is unchanged, and the phase shift is constant during the scattering event (\u03c0 for free \u000d\u000aelectrons). This process is referred to as Thomson scattering. Compton scattering is another common\u000d\u000aprocess that happens during a scattering event. This is incoherent and inelastic.\u000d\u000a39 In this work, we\u000d\u000awill focus on the Thomson scattering, which contains the structural information of the materials, \u000d\u000awhile the Compton scattering can be seen as a diffuse background in the data. For Thomson scattering, \u000d\u000athe magnitude of the wavevectors, ki and kf, is given by &'\u000d\u000a( . From geometrical considerations (Figure \u000d\u000a2.1), the scattering vector, Q, can be derived.\u000d\u000aEquation 2.1 Q = 2\ud835\ud835\ud835\ud835(\ud835) = 4\u03c0\u000d\u000a\ud835 sin(\ud835) , \ud835 = 2\u03c0\u000d\u000a\ud835\u000d\u000aScattering from an Atom\u000d\u000aSo far, we have only considered the scattering event from a single electron, which is considered as \u000d\u000ascattering from a point. However, most atoms consist of numerous electrons. When we consider \u000d\u000ascattering from multiple electrons in the same atom, we must include the effect of constructive or \u000d\u000adestructive interference. The interference effects will be dependent on the morphology of the electron ","6\u000d\u000acloud and the wavelength. Consequently, the scattering amplitude will be Q-dependent and is defined \u000d\u000aas the atomic form factor, f(Q). Effectively the atomic form factor is a Fourier transform of all \u000d\u000aelectron positions, r, in the electron cloud, \ud835.\u000d\u000a42, 43\u000d\u000aEquation 2.2 \ud835(\ud835) = ; \ud835(\ud835) \u2219 \ud835!\ud835\u2219\ud835\ud835\ud835\u000d\u000aFrom this equation, we can derive that when the scattering vector goes towards 0 \u00c5,%, \ud835 \u2192 0 \u00c5,%, \u000d\u000athen the atomic form factor goes toward the number of electrons in that atom, \ud835(\ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%) \u2192 \ud835.\u000d\u000aFor X-rays, the atomic form factor rapidly decreases with increasing scattering vector, Q, due to the \u000d\u000aspatial extension of the electron cloud. This is also the case for electron scattering since electrons also \u000d\u000ascatter from the electron cloud. However, this is not the case for neutrons that scatter from the nuclei\u000d\u000asince the nuclei can practically be seen as a point in space without extension. Consequently, the \u000d\u000aneutron form factor is a Fourier transform of a point scatterer (the nuclei) which results in a constant.\u000d\u000aScattering from a Material\u000d\u000aWe will now extend the theory of scattering from a single atom to real materials which consist of \u000d\u000amultiple atoms. In order to do so, we sum the scattering contribution of each atom, j, in the material \u000d\u000awith position, r. The scattering amplitude, \ud835, is thereby the sum of the Fourier transform of all atomic \u000d\u000aform factors in the material.\u000d\u000aEquation 2.3 \ud835(\ud835) = &\ud835!(\ud835) \u2219 \ud835\"#\ud835\u2219\ud835\ud835'\u000d\u000a(\u000d\u000a!)*\u000d\u000aBy measuring the scattering amplitude, it is possible to extract the atomic position of each atom in \u000d\u000athe material. In practice, it is not the amplitude that is measured during a scattering experiment but \u000d\u000athe scattering intensity, I. However, the scattering intensity is proportional to the magnitude of the \u000d\u000asquared scattering amplitude.43\u000d\u000aEquation 2.4\u000d\u000a\ud835(\ud835) \u221d |\ud835(\ud835)|\u000d\u000a+\u000d\u000aIn 1915, Debye derived that for materials where the scattering electrons are isotopically distributed\u000d\u000ain the material, as electrons normally are in a material, the intensity distribution can be written as:27, \u000d\u000a44","7\u000d\u000aEquation 2.5 \ud835(\ud835) = &\ud835!(\ud835) \u2219 \ud835\"(\ud835) \u2219\u000d\u000asin (\ud835 \u2219 \ud835!\")\u000d\u000a\ud835 \u2219 \ud835!\"\u000d\u000a#\u000d\u000a!,\"\u000d\u000aBy examining the intensity of the scattered X-rays from a material dependent on Q, we can thereby \u000d\u000aretrieve information about the structure of the given material.\u000d\u000a2.3 The two-headed scattering data representation: reciprocal- and real-space\u000d\u000aTraditionally, the mathematical expressions of scattering intensity of a material are expressed in Qspace as seen in the sections above. A simplified explanation for this is that the interaction between \u000d\u000athe material and the scattered wave happens in the scattering vector space i.e. Q-space. This is why \u000d\u000adata from a scattering measurement is measured in Q-space (or 2\ud835). Conventional diffraction \u000d\u000aexperiments as Single Crystal Diffraction (SCD) or Powder Diffraction (PD) are both measured and \u000d\u000amodelled in Q-space. However, it is also possible to present scattering data in r-space using a Fourier \u000d\u000atransformation. Fourier transformations are usually used to convert the variable of a dataset between \u000d\u000atime and frequency or as seen in the previous section it can be used to convert the electron cloud \u000d\u000adistribution into an atomic form factor. A Fourier transform is thereby a mathematical tool to \u2018change \u000d\u000athe space\u2019 of a dataset. Figure 2.2 illustrates simulated scattering data of a [Bi38O45] cluster in Qspace and the ideal Fourier transformation of the data from \ud835 = 0 \u00c5,% to \ud835 = \u221e \u00c5,%. Simulation \u000d\u000adetails are given in Appendix I.\u000d\u000aFigure 2.2: Simulated TS data of the [Bi38O45] cluster in Q-space is Fourier transformed to real-space data, the \u000d\u000aPDF.\u000d\u000aWhile the data in the two figures contain the same information, the representation of the information \u000d\u000ahas been changed. Diffraction peaks in the scattering pattern in Q-space, also referred to as Bragg \u000d\u000apeaks, originate from a periodic order of the atoms in the material. Since the scattering pattern in \u000d\u000aFigure 2.2 does not contain Bragg peaks but only broad features, we can conclude that there is no ","8\u000d\u000aperiodic order of the atoms in the [Bi38O45] cluster. The Q-space and r-space are inverse, which means \u000d\u000athat intensity in the low Q-regime corresponds to larger distances in real space. The large scattering \u000d\u000aintensity in the small-angle regime thereby tells us that the material consists of large units. This could \u000d\u000afor example be from the scattering of the nanoclusters.\u000d\u000a In r-space it is easier to extract information about the local order of the material. For example, one \u000d\u000acan easily identify peaks at r = 3.8 \u00c5, 6.6 \u00c5, 8.7 \u00c5 and 10.2 \u00c5 in Figure 2.2, which corresponds to \u000d\u000afrequent distances in the material. Based on the intensity, G(r), of these peaks, one can also index the \u000d\u000ascattering atom because bismuth scatters significantly more than oxygen. The scattering peaks with \u000d\u000ahigh intensity is from frequent Bi\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Bi distances in the structure, while the smaller peaks are from \u000d\u000aBi\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances in the material. Furthermore, one can determine the size of the material by simply \u000d\u000aidentifying the peak with the highest r-value, as seen about r = 12.2 \u00c5 in Figure 2.2. Q-space and rspace are thereby complementary data representations that highlight different information about the \u000d\u000astructure of a material. \u000d\u000a2.4 Using Total Scattering with Pair Distribution Function Analysis to reveal the \u000d\u000ainformation underneath the Bragg peaks\u000d\u000aAs demonstrated in the previous section, it is a powerful tool to analyse both the scattering data in Qspace and r-space since they highlight complementary information. However, in reality, obtaining \u000d\u000auseful r-space data from a scattering pattern in Q-space is a challenging process. Figure 2.3 shows an \u000d\u000aexample of Q-space scattering data of the [Bi38O45] cluster and the Fourier transformed r-space data. \u000d\u000aDetails about the experiment and how it has been transformed to r-space are given in Appendix I.\u000d\u000aFigure 2.3: Experimental TS data of the [Bi38O45] cluster in Q-space is Fourier transformed to real-space data, \u000d\u000athe PDF.","9\u000d\u000aThe experimental Q-space data of the [Bi38O45] cluster is very similar to the simulated data, but it has \u000d\u000aa background signal originating from incoherent scattering. However, the structural information is in \u000d\u000athe coherent scattering. We introduce the Total Scattering Structure Function, S(Q), which only uses \u000d\u000athe coherent scattering:\u000d\u000a42\u000d\u000aEquation 2.6 \ud835(\ud835) =\ud835./0(\ud835) + \u2329\ud835(\ud835)\u232a& \u2212 \u2329\ud835(\ud835)&\u232a\u000d\u000a\ud835\u2329\ud835(\ud835)\u232a&\u000d\u000aS(Q) normalizes the coherent elastic scattering intensity, \ud835./0, with the average scattering power, \u000d\u000a\u2329\ud835(\ud835)\u232a. For X-ray scattering data this results in an amplified signal in high Q which contains the local \u000d\u000astructural information. The scattering intensity in the high Q regime is low due to the Q-dependency \u000d\u000aof the atomic scattering factors. The \u2329\ud835(\ud835)\u232a& \u2212 \u2329\ud835(\ud835)&\u232a term arises from an imperfect cancellation \u000d\u000ain destructive and positive interference between scattering by different elements.42\u000d\u000aThe next mathematical treatment of the data is by calculating the Reduced Total Scattering Function, \u000d\u000aF(Q), where the high Q regime is further enhanced:42\u000d\u000aEquation 2.7 \ud835(\ud835) = \ud835(\ud835(\ud835) \u2212 1)\u000d\u000aF(Q) is the function we Fourier transform in order to obtain the Reduced Atomic Pair Distribution \u000d\u000aFunction, G(r), or also referred to as the PDF:42\u000d\u000aEquation 2.8 \ud835(\ud835) = 2\u000d\u000a\ud835 ; \ud835(\ud835) sin(\ud835 \u2219 \ud835) \ud835\ud835\u000d\u000a1\u000d\u000a2\u000d\u000aHowever, here we encounter another issue as a real experiment does not contain data from \ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%\u000d\u000ato \ud835 = \u221e \u00c5,%. In reality, we therefore use a PDF including artefacts from a limited Qrange of our \u000d\u000aexperiments:42\u000d\u000aEquation 2.9 \ud835(\ud835) = 2\u000d\u000a\ud835 ; \ud835(\ud835) sin(\ud835 \u2219 \ud835) \ud835\ud835\u000d\u000a3!\"#\u000d\u000a3!$%\u000d\u000aThe artefacts seen from the limit of Qmin are illustrated with a dotted line (baseline) in Figure 2.3. The \u000d\u000adata in the low Q-regime contains information about the size and shape of the particles, which \u000d\u000atherefore affects the baseline of the PDF. The limiting Qrange (Qmin > 0 \u00c5,% and Qmax < \u221e \u00c5,%) results \u000d\u000ain \u2018termination ripples\u2019 also illustrated in Figure 2.3. In order to decrease the effect of these artefacts, \u000d\u000awe perform TS experiments where the measured Qrange is as large as possible. In order to achieve a \u000d\u000alarge Qrange, we often use the rapid-acquisition PDF (RA\u2013PDF)45 setup where a 2D detector is moved \u000d\u000aas close to the sample as possible. Using RA\u2013PDF together with a low wavelength, Equation 2.1, \u000d\u000amakes it possible to obtain high Q-values often up to 20 \u2013 30 \u00c5-1\u000d\u000a. This could in principle also have \u000d\u000abeen done with the use of a point detector, however, an advantage of using a 2D detector is the \u000d\u000aachievement of higher intensity which makes it possible to do measurements with second resolution.","10\u000d\u000aWe have now shown that it is a challenging process to obtain useful data in r-space. However, with \u000d\u000aTS experiments, we can overcome this challenge with minor artefacts in the data. The data in r-space \u000d\u000ais a great tool to highlight complementary features to the Q-space data, especially the structural \u000d\u000ainformation of the local order. \u000d\u000a2.5 When the Problem is too \u2018Complex\u2019 to a Single Scattering Technique\u000d\u000aWhile TS data is an extremely powerful technique to characterize the structure of most materials, the \u000d\u000ainformation in a TS experiment is not always sufficient to characterize the structure. Sometimes, we \u000d\u000asimply need data from multiple experiments to determine the atomic structure. Figure 2.4\u000d\u000ademonstrates such an example. The figure compares total X-ray scattering plotted in Q-space, X-ray\u000d\u000aPDF and SAXS data of the [Bi18O36] and the [Bi22O38] cluster, Figure 2.4D\u2013E. The simulation details \u000d\u000aare given in Appendix I. The two clusters have no long-range order, and they have a very similar \u000d\u000alocal structure built up by [Bi6O8] octahedra, why it is difficult to distinguish them in both the total \u000d\u000aX-ray scattering data plotted in Q-space and the X-ray PDF data, Figure 2.4A\u2013B. The most prominent \u000d\u000adifference of the scattering from the two clusters in Figure 2.4A\u2013B is the scattering about Q = 0.45 \u000d\u000a\u00c5-1\u000d\u000a, which is also the part of the signal which gives rise to the SAXS pattern illustrated in Figure \u000d\u000a2.4C. However, due to instrumental limitations, the SAXS pattern is rarely measured during a TS","11\u000d\u000aexperiment and in practice these two measurements are done separately. The two clusters have \u000d\u000adistinct shapes, which makes them easily distinguishable in the SAXS data, Figure 2.4C.\u000d\u000aFigure 2.4: A) Comparison of the simulated total X-ray scattering, X-ray PDF and SAXS data of B) the [Bi18O36] \u000d\u000acluster and C) the [Bi22O38] cluster.5, 46\u000d\u000aNonetheless, the SAXS data does not describe the local order of the structure, which can be modelled \u000d\u000awith PDF data. A combination of PDF and SAXS data is therefore ideal to fully describe both the \u000d\u000aatomic structure and the morphology of the clusters. Even when combining the X-ray PDF and SAXS, \u000d\u000ait can be difficult to describe the atomic positions and vibrations of the oxygen atoms since oxygen \u000d\u000a(\ud8354\u000d\u000a5,678N\ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%O = 8) scatters significantly less than bismuth (\ud8359!\u000d\u000a5,678N\ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%O = 83). \u000d\u000aTherefore, one needs to do neutron scattering experiments to get a better description of the oxygen \u000d\u000aatoms where the bound coherent scattering length is much more similar for oxygen and bismuth\u000d\u000a(\ud8354\u000d\u000a#:;<6/=N\ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%O = 5.803 fm) and (\ud8359!\u000d\u000a#:;<6/=N\ud835 = 0 \u00c5,%O = 8.532 fm).\u000d\u000a41 For a \u000d\u000acomprehensive description of the atomic structure of these clusters, one would thereby need both TS\u000d\u000adata with PDF and SAXS from both X-rays and neutrons.","12\u000d\u000a3 Conventional Modelling of Scattering Data\u000d\u000aWe have now demonstrated that Total Scattering (TS) with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis \u000d\u000aand Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) can be powerful tools to describe the structure of a \u000d\u000amaterial. However, finding the right atomic structure is a cumbersome process, which often requires \u000d\u000aexpert knowledge. Ideally, we want automated structure characterization of PDF and SAXS data, \u000d\u000awhile doing the measurements, to effectively screen the nanocluster structure during cluster growth \u000d\u000aor nucleation reactions.\u000d\u000a The conventional process to find the right model is to first search the literature of what the expected \u000d\u000aoutcome of the synthesis is. Afterwards, the structural model must be found in a database as the \u000d\u000aInorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) or the Crystallography Open Database (COD) and in \u000d\u000athe end one must fit the model to the dataset. Sometimes this process is straightforward and can be \u000d\u000adone in hours. Often, this is not the case. As a scientist, we often pursue to synthesize a material, \u000d\u000awhich cannot be found in the database. In that case, one must create the model. Another issue can be \u000d\u000athat the structure during a synthesis is different than expected. In that case, one must fit several \u000d\u000astructures from the database to the dataset to find the right model and maybe also create some \u000d\u000astructural models to supplement the modelling with. Another issue discussed in section 2.5 is that \u000d\u000aseveral structures can give reasonable fits to the dataset. A final common problem is the fitting process \u000d\u000aof the model to the dataset. This is normally done with dedicated software such as PDFGui47, DiffpyCMI48, SASVIEW49, 50, RMCProfile51 or TOPAS52. The fitting process itself can take a long time. \u000d\u000aFurthermore, the scientist often has datasets from multiple techniques, which all have to match with \u000d\u000athe same model. Overall, the conventional process of finding the right model to describe the data is a \u000d\u000acumbersome process that often takes months and is constrained to expert users. Therefore, we need \u000d\u000anew approaches to analyse the data which is faster and more efficient than the conventional \u000d\u000aminimization approaches such as automated analysis that can be done while doing the measurements.","13\u000d\u000a4 Using Machine Learning to Automate Modelling of \u000d\u000aScattering Data\u000d\u000aWhen we have a chemical structure, we can analytically calculate its scattering pattern. However, \u000d\u000agoing from a scattering pattern to a chemical structure is a more difficult process that needs modelling. \u000d\u000aThis problem is called the inverse problem. While the inverse problem is often a difficult problem to \u000d\u000asolve for human people, it is an easy task for a ML algorithm. It has previously been shown that ML \u000d\u000acan automate the process from scattering data to structural model.36, 53, 54 ML serves as an excellent \u000d\u000aframework, which can tackle data from all sorts of techniques and data presentations for example \u000d\u000aboth PDF and SAXS data in both reciprocal-space and real-space. The ML algorithm can be trained \u000d\u000aon numerous examples to learn trends in the dataset, which it can use to classify structures given a \u000d\u000ascattering pattern. This type of machine learning, where it is trained on examples with a known \u000d\u000aanswer, is called supervised learning. We will demonstrate how supervised learning can be used to \u000d\u000amodel both PDF and PDF data individually but also combined. Furthermore, we will discuss how\u000d\u000avarious techniques can be used to extract reasons behind the predictions of a ML algorithm with a \u000d\u000afocus on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP).\u000d\u000a4.1 Gradient Boosting Decision Trees1\u000d\u000aGradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) is a type of supervised learning algorithm, which means \u000d\u000ait can predict a variable \ud835W based on the input feature list, x. This is done with the use of decision trees, \u000d\u000awhich predict variable, \ud835W, using yes/no questions55 as shown in Figure 4.1. Here it is demonstrated \u000d\u000ahow a tree-based method can be used to distinguish four different cluster structures based on their\u000d\u000aPDF. If a PDF is given as input feature list, x, to a decision tree, it can for example ask \u201cDoes the \u000d\u000aPDF have a Bi \u2013 O peak?\u201d (Figure 4.1 top question) and thereby distinguish between the clusters \u000d\u000acontaining oxygen atoms from the clusters not containing oxygen atoms.\u000d\u000a1 This Chapter is based on the theory presented in https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html ","14\u000d\u000aFigure 4.1: Example of the use of a GBDT algorithm to predict the cluster structure, \ud835\", based on its PDF as the \u000d\u000ainput feature list, x. The green box indicates the structure that would be predicted by this decision tree from \u000d\u000athis PDF.\u000d\u000aThe trees are made by minimizing an error function on already labelled data, or ground truths, y. This \u000d\u000aprocess is referred to as training the algorithm.\u000d\u000aEquation 4.1 \ud835\ud835\ud835 = \ud835\ud835\ud835\ud835\ud835>:. = &\ud835]\ud835!, \ud835_!\u000d\u000a(<)\u000d\u000a`\u000d\u000a=\u000d\u000a!$%\u000d\u000aWhere obj or error function is a function summing all the ith trees with their prediction values, \ud835W\ud835\u000d\u000a(\ud835)\u000d\u000a,\u000d\u000aat step t. yi is the true prediction value. The error function used to calculate the error value between \u000d\u000a\ud835W\ud835\u000d\u000a(\ud835) and yi is annotated l. The user-defined input of the maximum of trees is given as n. \u000d\u000a To understand the training process, let us consider an example where we train the algorithm to \u000d\u000apredict a 3rd degree polynomial (green curve) including noise as shown in Figure 4.2. In this case, we \u000d\u000adefine the variable M as the number of variables that are used in the polynomial to fit the data. \u000d\u000aHowever, in the GBDT algorithm, this transfers to how complex the algorithm is. It is thereby a \u000d\u000ameasure of how complex the GBDT algorithm is i.e. number of trees, depth of trees, leaf\u2019s per tree \u000d\u000aetc. When no training has been done, the algorithm will always predict an average value as visualized \u000d\u000ain Figure 4.2A. However, after some training (M = 1, Figure 4.2B) the algorithm still predicts a line ","15\u000d\u000abut now with the right slope. This period, where the algorithm has not finished training, is referred to \u000d\u000aas underfitting. After some training (M = 3), the algorithm catches the trend of a 3rd degree \u000d\u000apolynomial. This is where the algorithm is trained to an optimal point. But if the algorithm is trained \u000d\u000afurther, it will keep minimizing the error function and thereby describe all the points in the data which \u000d\u000ait has been trained on (training data), Figure 4.2D. While this behavior describes the training data \u000d\u000avery well (or perfectly), it would not generalize well to other points in a 3rd degree polynomial (the \u000d\u000agreen curve). This behavior where the algorithm does predict perfectly on the training set but does \u000d\u000anot generalize well is referred to as overfitting. There are multiple tools to avoid overfitting. The most \u000d\u000acommon tool is to split the data into training and validation set. Typically, this is a split of 80 % and \u000d\u000a20 % of the data. For every iteration the algorithm has been trained, it can be validated on the \u000d\u000avalidation set in order to determine if it is in the underfit or overfit regime. Thereby, the optimal \u000d\u000atraining iterations can be determined, in this case M = 3. Another way of avoiding overfitting is to \u000d\u000aincrease the size of the training set on the cost of longer training time.\u000d\u000aFigure 4.2: Modelling of a 3rd degree polynomial with noise using A) A constant, B) A line, C) A 3rd-degree\u000d\u000apolynomial and D) A 11th-degree polynomial.\u000d\u000a4.2 Feature Ranking using SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis\u000d\u000aTo analyse the nature of the GBDT algorithm or any other ML algorithms, it is very useful to know \u000d\u000awhich features are important for the algorithm in its predictions. This research field is called \u000d\u000ainterpretable machine learning and the method we will highlight is called feature ranking. \u000d\u000aThe most intuitive form of feature ranking is permutation feature importance, which measures the \u000d\u000aincrease in prediction error when values of a feature are permuted.56, 57 However, permutation feature \u000d\u000aimportance is highly inaccurate on correlated data.56\u000d\u000aAnother feature ranking method is Shapley values which come from coalitional game theory.58 A \u000d\u000aShapley value quantifies how much a feature contributes to a prediction compared to the overall\u000d\u000ax\u000d\u000ay\u000d\u000ax\u000d\u000ay\u000d\u000ax\u000d\u000ay\u000d\u000ax\u000d\u000ay\u000d\u000aA M = 0 B M = 1 C M = 3 D M = 11","16\u000d\u000aprediction. The Shapley value is calculated by calculating weighted and summed feature contributions \u000d\u000aover all the possible feature value combinations.\u000d\u000aEquation 4.2 \ud835\"(\ud835) = & |\ud835|! (\ud835 \u2212 |\ud835| \u2212 1)!\u000d\u000a\ud835!

The Shapley value does not need any form \u000d\u000aof user-defined inputs, however, they are computationally expensive to calculate.\u000d\u000a56 An alternative to \u000d\u000aShapley values are SHAP values, which is a fast and accurate approximation of Shapley values.38\u000d\u000aThe SHAP value is thereby a quantification of how much the input feature in a ML model pushes the \u000d\u000aprediction up or down from the average prediction. All the advantages of Shapley values do also \u000d\u000aaccount for SHAP values, however, it is an approximation that imposes smaller issues with highly \u000d\u000acorrelated features. Another issue with SHAP values is that the feature value under investigation is \u000d\u000arandomized to calculate the Shapley values, which not necessarily is a good assumption. Both issues \u000d\u000aare under research but, to my knowledge, no python modules that are easy to access have been \u000d\u000adeveloped yet.59, 60 In general, interpretable machine learning is not an exact science, why we must \u000d\u000ainterpret the models with great care.61","17\u000d\u000a5 Following Structural Changes during the Growth of \u000d\u000aAtomically Precise Metal Oxido Clusters from \u000d\u000acombined PDF and SAXS analysis2\u000d\u000aAtomically precise bismuth oxido nanoclusters have recently been extensively investigated due to the \u000d\u000awell-controlled synthesis of bismuth oxido clusters in various sizes,\u000d\u000a1, 2 3 4-7 and bismuth have been \u000d\u000aused in applications as radiopaque materials4, 16 and photocatalysis.\u000d\u000a8-12 The ability to control the size \u000d\u000aof bismuth oxido clusters also makes them an excellent model system to understand growth \u000d\u000amechanisms and nucleation reactions. The bismuth oxido clusters are reported to be built up by \u000d\u000a[BixOy]\u000d\u000az+ units with varying charge and nuclearity.\u000d\u000a2 The clusters are stabilized by a negative charged \u000d\u000aligand shell. We will in this Thesis neglect the charge and ligand shell and focus on the structural \u000d\u000amotifs of the bismuth oxido clusters. The clusters investigated here are built by edge-sharing \u000d\u000aoctahedral [Bi6O8] units. Figure 5.1B illustrates a single octahedral unit, while Figure 5.1C\u2013D \u000d\u000aillustrates the [Bi22O26] cluster which consists of 6 octahedral units and the [Bi38O45] which is built\u000d\u000aby 13 octahedral units. Generally, the nanoclusters can be considered as cut-outs of the fluorite-type \u000d\u000astructures as the \u03b4- and \u03b2-Bi2O3.\u000d\u000a2, 3, 62 Metal oxido clusters with different elements than bismuth are \u000d\u000aalso built of the octahedral [M6Ox] units as [Ce22O24],63 [Ce38O54],13 [U38O56],64 and [Pu38O56].\u000d\u000a65, 66\u000d\u000aThe [M6Ox] building block is therefore anticipated to play a central part in the cluster growth. \u000d\u000aWhile the cluster structures are well-known from single crystal diffraction, it is more challenging to \u000d\u000astudy the cluster growth in solution. Sattler et al. has investigated the cluster growth from [Bi6O8] to \u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] clusters using Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS),\u000d\u000a67 and identified the \u000d\u000a[Bi6O8], the [Bi22O26] and the [Bi38O45] as particularly stable cluster species. They also identified \u000d\u000aother fragments of bismuth oxido species in minor concentrations. However, while ESI-MS is very \u000d\u000asensitive to small concentrations of charged fragments, it cannot be used to follow structural changes \u000d\u000aduring a cluster growth reaction. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and Nuclear \u000d\u000aMagnetic Resonance (NMR) can be used to characterize the atomic structure of clusters in solution68-\u000d\u000a71 but both techniques are limited to the characterization of the atomic structure in the short range.\u000d\u000a2 This chapter is based on some of the results from Anker et. al., Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically \u000d\u000aPrecise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering \u000d\u000aAnalysis, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 2-12. Which is also included as Appendix V.","18\u000d\u000aHere, we use in situ TS with PDF and SAXS analysis to follow the formation of the [Bi38O45] cluster, \u000d\u000aby dissolving crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O72 (Figure 5.1A) in dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO). \u000d\u000aPDF is an excellent technique to characterize nanoclusters in solution because it is sensitive to the \u000d\u000aatomic structure of the clusters.\u000d\u000a65, 70 However, PDF is not sensitive to cluster shape and size\u000d\u000adistribution. Therefore, similar experiments have been done using SAXS which is highly sensitive to\u000d\u000ashape and size distribution.\u000d\u000a19, 48, 73, 74 To analyse the data, we have developed a new tool to identify \u000d\u000aintermediate species and map the reaction pathway. This automated intermediate extractor finds the \u000d\u000abest fitting structural motif that is contained in the [Bi38O45] cluster for every timestep of the reaction. \u000d\u000aThis approach does not identify the [Bi6O8] cluster motif as a stable intermediate, but it finds \u000d\u000aintermediate species with a stable core of [Bi22O26]. Furthermore, combined modelling of PDF and \u000d\u000aSAXS data is introduced with the use of the Debye equation. The combined modelling confirms the \u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] cluster as the reaction product and the [Bi22O26] cluster as the intermediate and it is used to \u000d\u000ayield a robust phase fraction of the two phases. Overall, automated modelling of combined PDF and \u000d\u000aSAXS data seems like a promising approach to understand cluster growth mechanisms in solution.\u000d\u000aFigure 5.1: The structure of the A) [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O crystal.\u000d\u000a72 B) single octahedral [Bi6O8] unit.

Experimental details are given in \u000d\u000aAppendix II. The two data representations highlight complimentary information. Figure 5.2A shows \u000d\u000aBragg peaks in the first 10 min of the reaction, which indicates a crystalline phase. It would be ","19\u000d\u000aintuitive that the crystalline phase at the beginning of the reaction is [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O, why \u000d\u000aa pattern of [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O were simulated and compared with the data in Q-space at t = \u000d\u000a0 min, Figure 5.2D. The experimental dataset possesses very similar peaks as the simulated dataset \u000d\u000aof crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O, however, the background of the experimental dataset \u000d\u000amakes it difficult to model with for example a Rietveld refinement. Therefore, the data were \u000d\u000ainvestigated in r-space instead. Background subtraction of the data in r-space is shown in Appendix \u000d\u000aII. The crystalline phase is observed in the r-space data, Figure 5.2B, as peaks up to large r-values. \u000d\u000aFigure 5.2E demonstrates a fit of the crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O phase to the first dataset \u000d\u000aof the in situ dataset in r-space. After t ~ 7 min the crystalline precursor begins to dissolve as seen \u000d\u000afrom the disappearing of the Bragg peaks in Figure 5.2A and by the disappearing of the peaks at high \u000d\u000ar-values in Figure 5.2B. Modelling in Q-space was not attempted due to the very broad scattering \u000d\u000asignal as seen in Figure 5.2A and further highlighted in Figure 5.2D. The broad features in the Qspace data are most likely due to diffuse scattering. Instead, the last frame of the data in r-space was\u000d\u000amodelled with a [Bi38O45] cluster, confirming that this is the product of the reaction, Figure 5.2F. \u000d\u000a However, as shown in Figure 2.4, the model that fits the TS data is not necessarily unique. \u000d\u000aTherefore, we conducted a similar SAXS experiment to confirm the results. TS and SAXS datasets \u000d\u000aobtained from similar experiments performed at lower temperatures (T = 30\u201360 \u00b0C) can be found in \u000d\u000aAppendix II. Figure 5.2C shows the in situ SAXS experiment obtained from crystalline \u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O in DMSO at T = 80 \u00b0C. Again, Bragg peaks are observed at the beginning \u000d\u000aof the reaction, which broadens after approximately 7 minutes. The Bragg peaks at the beginning of \u000d\u000athe reaction have the same Q-values as for the TS experiments, indicating that the crystal is \u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O. Again, the last frame of the experiment was modelled with the [Bi38O45] \u000d\u000acluster, Figure 5.2G, confirming the results from the PDF modelling.

The SAXS data are plotted in a log-log \u000d\u000aplot. Adapted from Anker et al.33\u000d\u000aWe have now established how crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O dissolves into a cluster in \u000d\u000aDMSO, which grows to the [Bi38O45] cluster. However, we have yet not investigated the intermediate \u000d\u000acluster species during the growth mechanism. Figure 5.3A\u2013B shows chosen PDF and SAXS data \u000d\u000athrough the in situ reaction. The data represents the crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O in the \u000d\u000abeginning of the reaction and the [Bi38O45] cluster in the end of the reaction. The intermediate dataset \u000d\u000ahas similar motifs as the last dataset but the PDF damps at a lower r-value indicating a smaller species. \u000d\u000aFurthermore, the intermediate species are more disordered than the [Bi38O45] cluster seen from the \u000d\u000aasymmetric peak in Figure 5.3D. Therefore, we suggest that the intermediate must be structurally\u000d\u000acorrelated with the [Bi38O45] cluster but present as a smaller and more disordered species. ","21\u000d\u000a [Bi6O8] cluster has previously been theoretically predicted to form in DMSO with molecular \u000d\u000adynamic simulations1 and experimentally it has been described as particularly stable.62, 67 Therefore, \u000d\u000athe PDF and SAXS scattering patterns were simulated from the [Bi6O8] cluster and compared to data \u000d\u000athrough the reaction, Figure 5.3A\u2013B. The simulated data of the [Bi6O8] cluster does not match any of \u000d\u000athe datasets and it is too small based on the lack of long-range peaks in the PDF. Oppositely, the \u000d\u000aintermediate PDF or SAXS data is not well described by the [Bi38O45] cluster either, Figure 5.3C and \u000d\u000aFigure 5.3E. \u000d\u000aFigure 5.3: Comparisons between calculated patterns from an isolated [Bi6O8] unit and experimental (A) PDFs \u000d\u000aand (B) SAXS data (plotted on a log-log scale).

Adapted from Anker et al.33\u000d\u000aTo understand the size evolution through the reaction, we applied SAXS form factor analysis of the \u000d\u000ain situ SAXS data using a spherical model with a lognormal size distribution. Figure 5.4 shows the \u000d\u000achange of diameter and dispersity of the clusters through the reaction. Modelling details and two \u000d\u000aexamples of fits are given in Appendix II. During reaction, the clusters grow and get more \u000d\u000amonodisperse. We therefore attempt to fit other bismuth oxido clusters with a similar local structure \u000d\u000aas the [Bi38O45] but with a smaller size. Figure 5.5 illustrates fits of various cluster sizes from [Bi6O8] \u000d\u000ato the [Bi38O45] to the intermediate PDF dataset.

However, to get an overview of the intermediate species during the reaction, we\u000d\u000acreated an algorithm that automatically extracts the intermediate structure which I refer to as \u000d\u000aautomated intermediate extractor. Automated modelling has previously been proposed by Yang et \u000d\u000aal.35 and Banerjee et al.30 who automated characterization of crystal structures and metal \u000d\u000ananoparticles. In another recent study, Christiansen et al. extract structural motifs of disordered \u000d\u000amolybdenum particles by automatically fitting fragments of known polyoxometalate structures to the \u000d\u000aPDF.22 I will refer to this approach as automated motif extractor.\u000d\u000a The method uses the methodology in the latter paper. We have adapted automated motif extractor\u000d\u000ato extract intermediate species of in situ PDF data. The principle of the algorithm is illustrated in \u000d\u000aFigure 5.6. First, the last frame of the dataset is modelled, which we know corresponds to the [Bi38O45] \u000d\u000acluster. The goal is to validate that there is no smaller structural motif with the same local order that \u000d\u000afits the data better than the [Bi38O45] cluster. This is checked by removing atoms systematically from \u000d\u000athe structure and fit them to the data. In order to test all combinations of atoms, which is done in \u000d\u000aautomated motif extractor, 382 \u2013 1 fits have to be made. Since this is not computationally feasible, \u000d\u000awe restrict the algorithm to remove up to 8 atoms from the outer shell of the [Bi38O45] cluster. Finally,\u000d\u000aall oxygen atoms which were not bonded to at least a single Bi atom were removed. The longest \u000d\u000aallowed bond length was set to 2.5 \u00c5, which is the longest Bi\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distance observed in the \u000d\u000aexperimental PDFs. The best-fitting model is chosen based on the Rwp value. When this procedure is \u000d\u000adone, the process is proceeded for the next frame in the dataset (starting from the last and going \u000d\u000atowards the first frame). The best-fitted structure from the previous frame is now added 3 atoms in \u000d\u000athe outer shell and the procedure is continuing with removing up to 8 atoms.","24\u000d\u000aFigure 5.6: The pseudo-code of the automated modelling process shows that: firstly, the last frame of the in situ\u000d\u000adataset is modelled with the [Bi38O45] cluster structure, and all structures where up to 8 Bi atoms from the outer \u000d\u000ashell is removed together with non-bonding oxygens. This is 28 = 256 candidate structures in total. The bestfitting structure is added three Bi atoms and used as the starting-point for the fitting of the second-last frame. \u000d\u000aThe addition of the Bi-atoms is done in order to prevent false minima in the algorithm.

Adapted from Anker et al.33\u000d\u000aThis modelling approach gives an overview of the best fitting intermediate species through the \u000d\u000areaction that has the same structural motif as the [Bi38O45] cluster.

For the high temperature dataset, T = 80 \u00b0C, large structures with about \u000d\u000a32 atoms are preferred, while plateaus of structures with 26 atoms and 22 atoms are stable for the \u000d\u000adataset obtained at T = 60 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C.

Therefore, it was investigated if the data is \u000d\u000abetter described with a 2-phase system of the [Bi22O26] and [Bi38O45] cluster compared to the best \u000d\u000afitting average structure obtained from the automated intermediate extractor.\u000d\u000a In Figure 5.9 data from four steps during the reaction is investigated. The best-fitting average cluster \u000d\u000amodel from the automated motif extractor is compared with a 2-phase refinement of the [Bi22O26] and \u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] cluster using PDF and SAXS Debye modelling and SAXS form factor analysis. Late in the \u000d\u000areaction, the one-structure model is very similar to the 2-phase refinement. However, earlier in the \u000d\u000areaction, T = 30 \u00b0C, the 2-phase refinement is describing the SAXS data significantly better. Thereby, \u000d\u000ait can be concluded that the 2-phase refinement using the [Bi22O26] and [Bi38O45] cluster yields the \u000d\u000abest description of the data throughout the entire reaction.

Figure 5.10\u000d\u000ashows the phase fraction of the two clusters during the reaction at temperatures T = 80 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and \u000d\u000a30 \u00b0C.

After the crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O is \u000d\u000adissolved in DMSO, the [Bi22O26] phase is dominant. However, during the reaction, the [Bi22O45] \u000d\u000acluster species grow to the [Bi38O45] cluster which ends as the dominant phase at high temperature, T\u000d\u000a= 80 \u00b0C, or after a long time at room temperature, Appendix II, which also shows that the results are \u000d\u000asimilar if the [Bi6O4(OH)4(NO3)6(H2O)2]\u00b7(H2O) crystal is used as the crystalline precursor. At all \u000d\u000athree temperatures, the results from the PDF and SAXS analysis follow the same trend, indicating \u000d\u000athat the kinetics of the experiments are close to equivalent.

Firstly, the [Bi38O45] cluster is tested with all candidate \u000d\u000astructures where up to 8 Bi atoms from the outer shell are removed. The best-fitting candidate is then \u000d\u000aused as a starting point for the next frame. Here, 3 atoms are added to the outer shell whereafter the \u000d\u000aprocedure is redone. This process is iteratively repeated for the entire dataset. However, the presented \u000d\u000amethod is computationally expensive, and the candidate structures are limited to all structures with \u000d\u000aup to 8 Bi atoms removed limiting, whereas we in principle would like to test all candidate structures \u000d\u000awhere up to 38 Bi atoms are removed. With this drastic constrain, the algorithm still takes a few days \u000d\u000ato run on a MacBook Pro 2017. For each frame, the algorithm produces 28 fits, which each yields an \u000d\u000aRwp value (A description of the Rwp value is given in Appendix III). For the automated motif extractor, \u000d\u000ait is only the model with the lowest Rwp value, which is used for further analysis, thereby discarding \u000d\u000athe information of all other fits. \u000d\u000a Here, we introduce a new approach using machine learning (ML) to evaluate results from automated \u000d\u000amodelling. Machine Learning based Motif Extractor (ML-MotEx), which is illustrated in Figure 6.1, \u000d\u000afirst builds a catalogue of hundreds or thousands of candidate structure motifs which are all \u2018cutouts\u2019 \u000d\u000afrom a chosen starting structure, and then fit these individual models to a dataset. The structures and \u000d\u000aRwp values from each fit are handed to an ML algorithm applying gradient boosting decision trees \u000d\u000a(GBDTs), which learns to predict Rwp values based on an atomic structure model. This allows \u000d\u000aexpanding the structural space that can be evaluated compared to the brute-force methods. Most \u000d\u000aimportantly, the ML-MotEx algorithm then outputs quantified values of how important each atom or \u000d\u000afeature in the starting structure is for the fit to yield a low Rwp value with the given fitting algorithm. \u000d\u000aThis is done by using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, as discussed in detail below.38\u000d\u000a ML-MotEx is significantly faster and less biased than the brute-force intermediate extractor due to \u000d\u000athe ability to use the information from all the fits made. Furthermore, we extend the method to use a \u000d\u000a\u2018cookie-cutter\u2019 strategy to generate a catalogue of candidate structure motifs. We demonstrate that it \u000d\u000ais possible to obtain knowledge of dominating structural motifs from PDF data in an automated ","33\u000d\u000amanner using ML. We show a simple example on a single dataset where the [Bi38O45] cluster is cut \u000d\u000aout of the \u03b2-Bi2O3 structure with the use of ML-MotEx. However, in principle, the ML-MotEx \u000d\u000aapproach can be applied to find intermediate species in an in situ dataset, allowing more robust results \u000d\u000athan the brute-force intermediate extractor presented in Chapter 5.2.\u000d\u000aFigure 6.1: Illustration of how ML-MotEx extracts the structural motif that fits the data from a starting model \u000d\u000aby generating a catalogue of candidate structure motifs, fitting them to the data, training a machine learning \u000d\u000aalgorithm to predict the Rwp value and finally calculating quantified values of atom importance for the fit \u000d\u000aquality.\u000d\u000a6.1 From input to output: ML-MotEx in 4 steps\u000d\u000aOverview of the algorithm\u000d\u000aML-MotEx consists of four parts, which are all fully automatic. These four parts are shown in the\u000d\u000asimplified pseudo-code of the algorithm in Figure 6.2. In the first part, a starting model is used to \u000d\u000agenerate a catalogue of candidate structure motifs. In the second part, a fitting script is used to fit the \u000d\u000agenerated candidate structure motifs to the dataset. The fitting parameters can be seen in Appendix \u000d\u000aIII. In the third part, the ML algorithm is optimized and trained, while SHAP values of the structural \u000d\u000afeatures in the models are calculated in the fourth part. The output of the algorithm is thus the starting \u000d\u000amodel along with SHAP values indicating the importance of each individual atom in the structure, or ","34\u000d\u000ain other words; how much each individual atom affects the Rwp value either positively or negatively. \u000d\u000aA further description of the individual steps of the algorithm is given in the next sections.\u000d\u000aFigure 6.2: Pseudo-code that describes the four steps of the ML-MotEx algorithm.\u000d\u000aPart 1: Creation of a catalogue of candidate structure motifs\u000d\u000aThe first step in ML-MotEx is to use a starting structure model to generate a catalogue of candidate \u000d\u000astructure motifs, which are all fitted to the data. In order to only produce physically sensible clusters\u000d\u000afrom the \u03b2-Bi2O3 structure, the strategy for generating the structural motifs is different than for the \u000d\u000abrute-force automated intermediate extractor. Rather than using permutations over different atoms in \u000d\u000athe structure, we cut out geometrically reasonable shapes using a \u2018cookie-cutter\u2019 strategy. Instead of \u000d\u000adeleting a number of random atoms, a range of reasonable shapes and sizes are made from the \u03b2Bi2O3 structure. Four shapes are used; spherical, cubic, ellipsoidal and disk in appropriate sizes \u000d\u000aconcerning the starting model. All the atoms in the starting model were kept or removed according to \u000d\u000aif they were inside the geometric object or not. Further details about the cookie-cutter algorithm can \u000d\u000abe found in Appendix III. One of the advantages of the cookie-cutter strategy is that we get structural \u000d\u000aparameters like shape, size, volume and sphericity, from the candidate structure motifs, which we fit \u000d\u000athe data. Sphericity is a measure of how spherical an object is. A sphere has a sphericity of 1, while \u000d\u000aa cube has a sphericity of 0.806 and an ellipsoids sphericity depends on its radii. The equation and a \u000d\u000adetailed description of sphericity are given in Appendix III. The cookie-cutter procedure is used to \u000d\u000agenerate the catalogue of candidate structure motifs, while the corresponding fits are done with a\u000d\u000afitting algorithm to yield a Rwp value.\u000d\u000aPart 2: Fitting the catalogue of candidate structure motifs to the data\u000d\u000aIn the next step, we fit each of the structures in the catalogue of candidate structure motifs to the \u000d\u000aexperimental PDF. We here use the Python-based program Diffpy-CMI48 for PDF fitting, but this \u000d\u000acould equally be done with other software packages such as DISCUS,78, 79 TOPAS,52 or any other ","35\u000d\u000aprogram that can be used to model X-ray or neutron scattering data. The output of the fit is a Rwp\u000d\u000avalue reflecting the quality of the fit. \u000d\u000aPart 3: Predicting Rwp values using Gradient Boosting Decision Trees\u000d\u000aWe use GBDTs to evaluate the results from the fits of the catalogue of the candidate structure motifs \u000d\u000ato the experimental PDF. The aim of this step is for the algorithm to learn how to predict Rwp values, \u000d\u000agenerated in part 2, based on the input which is the catalogue of candidate structure motifs generated \u000d\u000ain part 1. \u000d\u000a GBDT is a tool that can do classification or regression using decision trees. In this work, we are \u000d\u000ausing the GBDT tool to do the regression task of predicting the Rwp value based on the structural \u000d\u000ainput given as zeros or ones. The optimization is done by making trees of \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 questions on \u000d\u000awhether to keep an atom in the structure or not (based on the resulting Rwp value). An example of a\u000d\u000asimple tree can be seen in Figure 6.1. When atom 4 is present in the structure, the GBDT algorithm \u000d\u000awill predict a Rwp value that is 5 % lower than if atom 4 is not present in the structure. In the same \u000d\u000away, it will predict an Rwp value that is 12 % lower if atom 1 is present in the structure. In reality, the \u000d\u000aGBDT algorithm will make 100 trees and do a weighting of them. \u000d\u000a In this project, XGBoost55 has been used as the GBDT algorithm with the use of default parameters \u000d\u000aexcept for learning rate and max depth, which were optimized with the use of Bayesian optimization \u000d\u000ausing 50 iterations and cross-validation split on 3.80 A lower iteration number and fewer crossvalidation splits can be used to achieve faster optimization time, on the cost of performance. The \u000d\u000aprocess of training the GBDT algorithm is done on 80 % of the data. The last 20 % of the data is used \u000d\u000ato validate the performance of the algorithm. The GBDT algorithm performance is better with a large \u000d\u000aamount of training data, which in this tool is provided by creating a larger catalogue of candidate \u000d\u000astructure motifs and fitting them to the data.\u000d\u000aPart 4: Quantifying the effect of structural features with SHAP values\u000d\u000aSHAP values are used to analyze the Rwp values resulting from the process described above. The \u000d\u000aamplitude of a SHAP value contains information about how important a structural feature is, while \u000d\u000athe sign of the SHAP value reflects whether the feature affects the Rwp value of the fit towards 1 (poor \u000d\u000afit) or 0 (perfect fit), in other words why it is important. In this work, the results can be visually \u000d\u000ainspected as the atoms in the starting model are colored according to their SHAP values using green \u000d\u000afor low SHAP values (tendency to keep atom, pushing Rwp down) and red for high SHAP values \u000d\u000a(tendency to remove atom, pushing Rwp up). Any 3D visualization tools for structural models, which \u000d\u000acan visualize XYZ files, can be used such as VESTA81 or CrystalMaker.82","36\u000d\u000a6.2 Extracting Structural Motifs from PDF data of the [Bi38O45] cluster\u000d\u000aIt is well known that [Bi38O45] (Figure 6.3A) is a stable cluster structure.62, 83 If considering the cluster \u000d\u000astructure, it can be seen that this can be described as a cut-out of the \u03b2-Bi2O3 structure, Figure 6.3B.\u000d\u000a62, \u000d\u000a83 We can therefore apply the ML-MotEx method for analysis of a PDF from this cluster, using a \u03b2Bi2O3 starting model. The starting model is thus a discrete model consisting of 2x2x3 unit cells of the \u000d\u000a\u03b2-Bi2O3 structure.\u000d\u000a Figure 6.3C shows the experimental PDF obtained from a solution of [Bi38O45] clusters compared \u000d\u000ato the simulated PDF data of the discrete starting model built from 2x2x3 unit cells of the \u03b2-Bi2O3 \u000d\u000astructure. As expected, the local range of the PDFs from the two structures are highly similar, but \u000d\u000apeaks to higher r-values are present for the \u03b2-Bi2O3 starting model. This illustrates that the local \u000d\u000astructure is the same in the [Bi38O45] sample as the starting model, but that the cluster size is smaller.\u000d\u000aFigure 6.3: A) The [Bi38O45] cluster B) The \u03b2-Bi2O3 structure with highlighted polyhedra in red and green, \u000d\u000awhere the green corresponds to the [Bi38O45] cluster. Some polyhedra are drawn as balls and stick instead, to \u000d\u000aenhance visibility. C) Comparison of the experimental PDF of the [Bi38O45] cluster and simulated data of a \u000d\u000a2x2x3 unit cell of \u03b2-Bi2O3. The simulation parameters mimic typical values of a PDF dataset and can be seen \u000d\u000ain Appendix III.\u000d\u000aAfter constructing and fitting these models to the PDF, we can analyze the results from the bruteforce approach before moving to ML. Figure 6.4A shows all the Rwp values obtained from the PDF \u000d\u000afits, where the fit quality is plotted versus the number of bismuth atoms. The refinement parameters ","37\u000d\u000aare given in Appendix III. It is evident that the Rwp values are lowest when a structure of 38 Bi atoms \u000d\u000ais used to fit the data, however, the curve is not very shallow. In Figure 6.4B, the Rwp values are\u000d\u000aplotted for the 4 different shape categories used in the \u2018cookie-cutter\u2019 strategy. The color of the point\u000d\u000aindicates the sphericity. The plot shows that cube-shaped structures generally result in higher Rwp\u000d\u000avalue than the other shapes, ruling out this shape for describing the cluster structure. The spheres \u000d\u000agenerally give good fits, but the structures providing the lowest Rwp values are not spherical. The \u000d\u000astructures resulting in the lowest Rwp values are ellipsoids or disks, however, common for those two \u000d\u000ashapes is that the best fitting structures have high sphericity, meaning that the structure is very close \u000d\u000ato being spherical. In Figure 6.4C, the results of fitting spherical models to the data is further analyzed. \u000d\u000aThe figure shows the Rwp value plotted as a function of radius, showing a minimum at ca. 7.2 \u00c5. \u000d\u000aSimilar plots of the volume and ellipsoidal radius are shown in Appendix III.\u000d\u000aFigure 6.4: Overview of the Rwp values of the PDF fits versus important structural parameters. A) The Rwp\u000d\u000avalues versus the number of bismuth atoms present in the structure, B) The Rwp value versus the shape and \u000d\u000asphericity of the structures and C) The Rwp value versus the spherical radius of the structures made with a \u000d\u000aspherical shape.\u000d\u000aWe now again move to ML-analysis for further atomistic understanding. Again, this allows taking all \u000d\u000a5950 fits into account when finding an appropriate structural motif that fits the data. Figure 6.5 shows \u000d\u000athe results of the SHAP analysis of the motifs made from the discrete starting model built from 2x2x3 \u000d\u000aunit cells of the \u03b2-Bi2O3 structure and their corresponding Rwp values. ","38\u000d\u000aFigure 6.5: SHAP summary plot from ML-MotEx utilized on PDF data from the [Bi38O45] cluster.\u000d\u000aThe SHAP value plot shows that the model does not prefer a low number (blue color) atoms in the \u000d\u000amodel, however, when more than approx. 20 atoms is reached, it does not make a large difference in\u000d\u000ahow many atoms are included in the model. The plot also tells the effect of each atom\u2019s contribution \u000d\u000ato the prediction of the Rwp value of the model. For example, atom 24 has negative SHAP values \u000d\u000awhen it is included in the candidate structure motif. We interpret that atom 24 contributes to a low \u000d\u000aRwp value. We can thereby construct the structure of the 38 Bi atoms with the lowest SHAP value \u000d\u000awhen they are included in the model. This model is illustrated in Figure 6.6B.\u000d\u000a In Figure 6.6, the result from the brute-force approach (Figure 6.6A) is compared to the result of \u000d\u000athe ML-MotEx approach (Figure 6.6B). The best structure found with the brute-force approach is \u000d\u000ashown in Figure 6.6A where the green octahedra represent parts of the [Bi38O45] structure. This \u000d\u000astructure can be fitted to the PDF data with an Rwp value of 16.6 % as seen in Figure 6.6C. Figure \u000d\u000a6.6B illustrates the structure when all other than the 38 Bi atoms with the lowest SHAP value are \u000d\u000aremoved. This structure fits the data with an Rwp value of 17.4 % (Figure 6.6D), however it contains ","39\u000d\u000amore of the original [Bi38O45] structure than the brute-force model does. The fitting parameters and \u000d\u000afits of the [Bi38O45] are shown in Appendix III.\u000d\u000aFigure 6.6: Structural visualization of the kept atoms in the 2x2x3 unit cell of \u03b2-Bi2O3 with highlighted \u000d\u000apolyhedra from the [Bi38O45] cluster using A) The Brute-force approach.

D) The cluster illustrated in B.\u000d\u000aIn conclusion, the brute-force routine itself of making a catalogue of candidate structure motifs and \u000d\u000ainvestigating the Rwp values reveals valuable insight into the structure. However, it is still a \u000d\u000acumbersome process to use all this information to build a structure that fits the data. One can simply \u000d\u000ause the best fit, however, it is a biased approach, and it does not necessarily represent the majority of \u000d\u000athe structures with the best fits. By applying ML-MotEx a reasonable structural estimate is obtained, \u000d\u000awhich can be used with chemical knowledge to construct the right model that fits the data. \u000d\u000a We also tested the ML-MotEx approach on SAXS data. However, as shown in Appendix III, the \u000d\u000amissing atomistic information means that the SAXS results are less meaningful, and PDF is thus \u000d\u000abetter suited for identifying which atoms should be included in the model using the ML-MotEx \u000d\u000aapproach than SAXS data is.","40\u000d\u000a7 Using a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Algorithm \u000d\u000ato screen large Databases of matching \u000d\u000aPolyoxometalate Clusters to a PDF\u000d\u000aCharacterizing the atomic model in PDF data via conventional data analysis methods was in Chapter \u000d\u000a5 demonstrated to be a highly complicated and time-consuming process.\u000d\u000a Here, We present POMFinder, an algorithm that can automatically identify polyoxometalate (POM) \u000d\u000aclusters from PDF data. The algorithm has been trained on simulated PDF data of 443 POM cluster\u000d\u000afragments, which are cut out of metal oxide crystals from the Crystallography Open Database (COD) \u000d\u000aand the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). The algorithm predicts the right structure 94.0 \u000d\u000a% of the time on simulated data, and it provides us with promising results on experimental PDF data. \u000d\u000aWe furthermore show that the method can be extended to jointly use data from multiple scattering \u000d\u000atechniques instead of modelling the data separately: the \u2018complex modelling\u2019 approach. We use PDF \u000d\u000aand SAXS data. We demonstrate that the algorithm can instantly predict the structure of free \u000d\u000a[H2W12O40]\u000d\u000a6- ions with the \ud835-Keggin structure.32 POMFinder enables automated PDF and SAXS\u000d\u000amodelling, which can be used directly while measuring the data without the need for any prior \u000d\u000aknowledge.\u000d\u000a7.1 From input to output: POMFinder in 3 steps\u000d\u000aOverview of how POMFinder was created\u000d\u000aThe goal of this project is to create a ML algorithm that can match an atomic structure to an \u000d\u000aexperimental dataset. We have chosen to focus on PDF and SAXS data as the structural \u000d\u000acharacterization techniques, however, in principle the dataset can be any information that can be used \u000d\u000ato characterize an atomic structure. We used a self-created POM database but this could be any \u000d\u000adatabase of any structure type.\u000d\u000a A pseudo-code of how to create POMFinder can be seen in Table 7.1. The algorithm consists of 3 \u000d\u000aparts, which are building a POM database, simulating data from the database and training a GBDT \u000d\u000aalgorithm on the simulated data. The structural database of POM clusters is built from CIF files from \u000d\u000aboth COD and ICSD using chemical restraints appropriate for POM clusters. Afterwards, a number \u000d\u000aof datasets of each POM cluster are simulated using Latin hypercube sampling84 and a GBDT ","41\u000d\u000aalgorithm55 is trained to classify which POM structure the dataset matches. In the following sections, \u000d\u000awe will elaborate on how POMFinder is created.\u000d\u000aTable 7.1: Pseudo-code that describes how to create the POMFinder algorithm.\u000d\u000aPart 1: Building a database of polyoxometalate clusters\u000d\u000aThe COD and ICSD databases contain a total of 412,738 and 166,831 crystallographic information \u000d\u000afiles (CIFs). First, the database is screened for CIFs that fulfill the desired chemical restraints. We\u000d\u000achose to restrain the structures to have the same number of metal and oxygen atoms as the reported \u000d\u000astructures in a review about POM clusters in solution by N. I. Gumerova and A. Rompel.85 This \u000d\u000arestrained the database to 56 different metal \u2013 oxygen compositions, yielding 1281 CIFs in total. A \u000d\u000afull list of metal \u2013 oxygen compositions used for this project is shown in Appendix IV. Clusters were \u000d\u000acut out of the remaining CIFs by creating a 2x2x2 unit cell of the crystal and extracting all clusters of \u000d\u000aatoms that were not bonded to other atoms in the structure. A 2x2x2 unit cell is needed to capture all \u000d\u000aclusters, which are split upon several unit cells. All clusters that did not fulfill the chemical restraints \u000d\u000a(the 56 different metal \u2013 oxygen compositions) were removed. Figure 7.1 illustrates an example of a \u000d\u000acluster that was cut out of a porous framework based on Keggin polyoxoanions, \u000d\u000aK2NaH2[BW12O40]\u221912H2O.\u000d\u000a86","42\u000d\u000aFigure 7.1: An example of a cluster fragment from a crystal structure.

Be aware that it \u000d\u000ais not guaranteed that the clusters are perfectly cut out of the structure with this routine, which makes \u000d\u000ait important to inspect the results of POMFinder from a chemical point of view. In order to remove \u000d\u000asimilar structures, all structures were compared using the Pearson value correlation of simulated PDFs \u000d\u000aof the structures. This process is done iteratively by simulating a PDF of the 1st and 2nd cluster with \u000d\u000athe parameters given in Appendix IV and comparing their absolute Pearson value correlation. The \u000d\u000aPearson value correlation is a measure from -1 to 1 of how correlated two datasets are, where -1 \u000d\u000arepresents inverse datasets and 1 represents identical datasets. If the absolute Pearson value \u000d\u000acorrelation is higher than 0.99, the 2nd cluster is not included in the database. The 3rd cluster is \u000d\u000acompared to the 1st and 2nd cluster by the same procedure, etc. The value of 0.99 was defined by \u000d\u000amanual inspecting structures, their corresponding PDFs and the Pearson value correlation. Examples \u000d\u000aof 3 structures, their corresponding simulated PDFs and the PDFs Pearson value correlation can be \u000d\u000aseen in Appendix IV. This process was done with all the 926 structures yielding 443 unique structures.","43\u000d\u000aPart 2: Simulating data from the POM structures\u000d\u000aFor each structure, a number of PDF or SAXS data are simulated, N, with a broad range of \u000d\u000ainstrumental parameters using Latin hypercube sampling84 to determine the parameters.

The PDFs are normalized to have the largest peak at G(r) = 1, and G(r \u2264 1 \u000d\u000a\u00c5) = 0 since it is very unlikely to have atomic distances that contribute to the signal in this range of \u000d\u000athe PDF. The SAXS data are normalized to have the largest intensity at I(Q) = 1.

For each structure, 2 random of the N simulated PDFs are set aside during training \u000d\u000aof the model and later used as validation- and test set. The validation set is used to validate when the \u000d\u000aGBDT algorithm has converged.\u000d\u000a The loss curve (multiclass log loss), for the case where N = 100, is plotted in Appendix IV, which \u000d\u000ashows that the algorithm can predict the training data with 100 % accuracy, while the validation data \u000d\u000ais predicted with a small error.

As seen in Table 7.2, the scientist simply \u000d\u000aprovides a dataset as input to POMFinder and it will return a structure as output. The dataset can \u000d\u000acurrently be a X-ray PDF, neutron PDF, electron PDF or a SAXS dataset. The output will be given \u000d\u000ain XYZ format providing the elements and coordinates of all the atoms in the structure.\u000d\u000aTable 7.2: Pseudo-code that describes how to use the POMFinder algorithm.\u000d\u000a7.3 Characterizing the POM structure from experimental X-ray PDF data by \u000d\u000ascreening the COD & ICSD database in a second\u000d\u000aWe demonstrate the power of POMFinder on an experimental ex situ dataset of a 0.05 M ammonium \u000d\u000ametatungstate hydrate, (NH4)6[H2W12O40]\u2219H2O, solution which is known to yield free [H2W12O40]\u000d\u000a6-\u000d\u000aions with the \ud835-Keggin structure.32 Keggin structures, an example is seen in Figure 7.1B, have the \u000d\u000achemical composition [XM12O40]\u000d\u000an-\u000d\u000a, where X is a tetrahedrally coordinated cationic central atom in \u000d\u000athe middle of the cluster, M is the metal atom of the cluster and n is the negative charge of the cluster. \u000d\u000aKeggin clusters are divided into five rotational isomers, with increasing degree of edge-sharing: \u000d\u000a\ud835, \ud835, \ud835, \ud835 and \ud835.\u000d\u000a The input to POMFinder is the normalized PDF. The output is how probable it is that the normalized \u000d\u000aPDF originates from each of the 443 POM structures in our POM database, with a total sum of 100 \u000d\u000a%. We decided to investigate the five structures with the highest probability assigned by POMFinder, \u000d\u000awhich are most likely to be the right POM structure based on the POMFinder predictions. Figure 7.3\u000d\u000ashows the five best predictions, together with a comparison of the normalized PDF of the ","45\u000d\u000aexperimental dataset and the simulated PDF of the POM structure. The calculated PDF of the first \u000d\u000athree structures is very comparable to the normalized PDF, whereas the last two structures have \u000d\u000ascattering signals up to high r distances, which is not seen in the data. The last two structures are \u000d\u000atherefore concluded to be too large. The three best candidate structures are all fragments from CIF \u000d\u000afiles containing the Keggin structure. Some of them are not perfectly cut out though. The first two \u000d\u000astructures represent the \ud835-Keggin structure, while the third represents the \ud835-Keggin structure. The \u000d\u000abest candidate structure, Figure 7.3A, is a lacunary Keggin with three out of four triads of the \ud835-\u000d\u000aKeggin structure. This could indicate that the last triad in the structure is dynamic. This is supported \u000d\u000aby the 5th best prediction, which is a fragment built of two lacunary Keggins. The best candidate also \u000d\u000ahas a Si atom in the center, which impacts the peak intensity at r = 3.3 \u00c5 and r = 3.7 \u00c5. From this \u000d\u000apoint, one needs to use chemical intuition to build a proper model to describe the data. In this \u000d\u000asynthesis, hydrogen is the only cation in the reaction, which could be stabilized in the center of the \u000d\u000acluster. Additionally, the best candidate structures have an overweight of corner-sharing octahedra. \u000d\u000aTherefore, we conclude that the right model for the experimental dataset is [H2W12O40]\u000d\u000a6- with the \ud835-\u000d\u000aKeggin structure.","46\u000d\u000aFigure 7.3: Comparison of the normalized PDF of the 0.05 M ammonium metatungstate solution and the \u000d\u000acalculated PDF of A) a W9SiO34 Keggin-based fragment from the Na2[C(NH2)3]2[((CH3)2Sn(H2O))3(A-\ud835-\u000d\u000aSiW9O34)]\u00b710H2O crystal87, B) a W12O36 fragment from the K5(CoW12O40)\u00b720H2O crystal88, C) a W12O36\u000d\u000afragment from a crystal structure86 of a porous framework based on Keggin polyoxoanions, \u000d\u000aK2NaH2[BW12O40]\u221912H2O, D) a W18I3K3O75 fragment from the first crystallographically characterized89\u000d\u000atungstatoperiodate cluster of the form \u03b2*\u2010[H3W18O56(IO6)]6\u2212, and E) a W18P2O89 fragment from the Dawson \u000d\u000atype POM90 Li6[\u03b1-P2W18O62]\u00b728H2O.\u000d\u000aPOMFinder thereby provides a tool that can predict the metal oxido cluster from a PDF while \u000d\u000ameasuring the data, making it an ideal approach for structure characterization during a cluster growth \u000d\u000areaction or in the early stage of a nucleation process.\u000d\u000a7.4 We investigate how POMFinder works by using SHAP values to interpret the \u000d\u000afeatures\u000d\u000aWe have now established that POMFinder is a tool that can predict the POM structure of experimental \u000d\u000aPDFs of simple solutions. Yet, we do not fully understand how POMFinder makes predictions. In \u000d\u000aorder to get this understanding, we use SHAP analysis. SHAP is a measure of feature importance, \u000d\u000awhich yields information about how the ML algorithm exploits the individual features (Qmin, Qmax, ","47\u000d\u000aQdamp and rrange = 0 \u2013 10 \u00c5) to make its prediction. The amplitude of the SHAP value can be interpreted \u000d\u000aas how important the feature is or how large a difference it makes to the predictions. The sign of the \u000d\u000aSHAP value tells if the feature is confirming or disqualifying the specific structure as a match to the \u000d\u000adataset, or why the feature is important. In this project we only analyse the amplitude of the SHAP \u000d\u000avalue. Figure 7.4A shows a SHAP analysis of the simulated PDF of the \ud835-Keggin clusters. The two \u000d\u000amost important features are the G(r) value at r = 6.0 \u00c5 and r = 3.6 \u00c5. Figure 7.4B shows a comparison \u000d\u000aof the SHAP values with the simulated PDF. The highest SHAP values, thereby the most important \u000d\u000afeatures, are at G(r) values corresponding to the 1st and 2nd metal \u2013 metal shell distances. Therefore, \u000d\u000awe conclude that the ML algorithm predominantly bases its predictions on the intensities of the PDF \u000d\u000apeaks describing the 1st and 2nd metal \u2013 metal shell which is the dominant peaks in the PDF because \u000d\u000aW scatters significantly more than O. The model thereby bases its predictions according to the \u000d\u000ascattering theory outlined in Chapter 2.\u000d\u000aFigure 7.4: A) SHAP summary plot of the A) \ud835-Keggin cluster.

It is interesting to investigate how many PDFs are needed for it to learn the scattering \u000d\u000atheory and make accurate predictions. Figure 7.5 shows POMFinder\u2019s performance on the test set \u000d\u000awhen POMFinder is trained on 2, 3, 5, 8 and 98 PDFs per POM structure. The trend is clear: The \u000d\u000aperformance of POMFinder increases when it is trained on more data.\u000d\u000aFigure 7.5: The performance of the model trained with various amounts of X-ray PDFs per structure. Appendix \u000d\u000aIV shows the mean and standard deviation based on five iterations where the model has been trained on \u000d\u000adifferent simulated PDFs and predictions have been done on the same test set. \u000d\u000aIt has previously been shown that combined modelling of data from multiple scattering techniques \u000d\u000acan provide more robust results than the modelling of the data from individual scattering \u000d\u000atechniques.33, 48, 51, 73, 74, 77 However, it is a cumbersome process to do combined modelling of data \u000d\u000afrom multiple scattering techniques and it can be difficult to weigh the contribution from each \u000d\u000adataset.33, 48, 77 ML provides a unique framework, which weights the datasets automatically. \u000d\u000aFurthermore, it is extremely easy to transform an ML algorithm from handling one dataset to another. \u000d\u000aWe demonstrate the flexibility of POMFinder by replacing the X-ray PDF (xPDF) data with neutron \u000d\u000aPDF (nPDF), electron PDF (ePDF), X-ray SAXS (SAXS), a combination of xPDF/SAXS and a \u000d\u000acombination of xPDF/SAXS/nPDF. The simulation parameters for the SAXS data are given in \u000d\u000aAppendix IV. The simulation parameters for the nPDF and ePDF data are the same as for the xPDF \u000d\u000adata given in Appendix IV.\u000d\u000a Figure 7.6 shows the performance of POMFinder when using various amounts of data as well as \u000d\u000achanging the scattering technique the data is from. Generally, POMFinder has a comparable \u000d\u000a0\u000d\u000a20\u000d\u000a40\u000d\u000a60\u000d\u000a80\u000d\u000a100\u000d\u000aNumber of xPDF's per structure\u000d\u000aPerformance (%)\u000d\u000a2 3 5 8 98","49\u000d\u000aperformance when trained on xPDF, nPDF and ePDF data. The performance of POMFinder based on \u000d\u000aPDF or SAXS data cannot be compared, since it will be related to the range of noise included in the \u000d\u000asimulated datasets. With the given parameters in this study, Appendix IV, POMFinder is comparable \u000d\u000ain performance when it is trained on PDF and SAXS data. However, we can conclude that when \u000d\u000acombining information from both PDF and SAXS experiments, the performance increases. This \u000d\u000aexample shows the flexibility of the POMFinder and demonstrates the power of combined modelling. \u000d\u000aFigure 7.6: The performance of the model trained with various simulated datasets and different amounts of \u000d\u000adatasets per structure.

The measurements can be done in \u000d\u000aseconds allowing studies of cluster growth and nucleation mechanisms, which are important to \u000d\u000aunderstand in order to make new and functional materials. We have demonstrated that by using \u000d\u000aconventional PDF and SAXS analysis using minimization approaches as least-square refinements, it \u000d\u000ais possible to follow the cluster growth from [Bi6O8] to [Bi38O45] when [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O\u000d\u000acrystals are dissolved in DMSO.\u000d\u000a However, this modelling approach is restricted to expert users, and it is a time-consuming way to \u000d\u000amodel the data. We have demonstrated that automated modelling using least-squares minimization \u000d\u000aapproaches can extend the information that is normally gained from conventional modelling. In this \u000d\u000aThesis, it was used to identify the intermediate species as the [Bi22O26] cluster. Furthermore, I have \u000d\u000ademonstrated that combined PDF and SAXS modelling provides more robust results than analysis of \u000d\u000athe individual techniques. However, these methods are highly dependent on expert users given the \u000d\u000aright parameters to the algorithms and combined modelling of PDF and SAXS data must be weighted \u000d\u000aappropriately. \u000d\u000a We have also shown that both problems can be solved by replacing the least-squares minimization \u000d\u000aapproach with ML. ML provides a unique framework, which can predict structural models instantly \u000d\u000aand it weights datasets from multiple techniques automatically. We have shown this by training an\u000d\u000aalgorithm to predict the POM structure from a PDF in 94 % of the cases in the test set, while it can \u000d\u000apredict the cluster structure in 97 % of the cases if it is trained on both PDF and SAXS data. We have \u000d\u000afurthermore presented Machine Learning based Motif Extractor (ML-MotEx) that can identify the \u000d\u000aimportant structural motif in a PDF pattern. These methods are some of the first to automate the \u000d\u000aanalysis of scattering data using ML. The ML methods used here are tree-based algorithms, which \u000d\u000aare intuitive and easy to use. However, I imagine that more complicated neural networks as generative \u000d\u000amodels will outperform the tree-based methods in the future. Generative models can both predict the \u000d\u000achemical structure that matches a dataset but they are also able to map a space of chemical structures \u000d\u000aincluding properties and synthesis. ML using generative models can consequently be the tool that \u000d\u000acombines synthesis, structure and properties in a single 2D/3D map, which can freely be drawn from \u000d\u000ato do synthesis by design.","51\u000d\u000aAcknowledgements\u000d\u000aI would first like to thank my supervisor Assoc.

The first atom was the one with the \u000d\u000alowest SHAP value (pushes the Rwp value down) and the last atom was the atom with the highest \u000d\u000aSHAP value (pushes the Rwp value up). Afterwards, they were iteratively included in the model with \u000d\u000athe one with the lowest SHAP value first and fitted to the data. The Rwp values of the fits from this\u000d\u000aprocess is illustrated in Figure S21 for the SAXS and PDF data individually as well as combined. \u000d\u000aFrom Figure S21, the best fitting model for the PDF Rwp value is when the 37 atoms with the lowest \u000d\u000aSHAP values are kept in the model and the rest of the atoms are removed. This model is shown and \u000d\u000afitted to the PDF and SAXS data in Figure S23. Fitting details are given in Table S13.

In recent years, atomically\u000d\u000aprecise metal oxido nanoclusters of titanium,[2] cerium[3] and\u000d\u000abismuth have been intensively studied due to their wide range\u000d\u000aof applications, for example, for photocatalysis,[2] oxygen\u000d\u000astorage,[3] in medicine,[4] as radiopaque materials[4b, 5] or as\u000d\u000abuilding blocks for advanced catalysts.[6] Apart from their\u000d\u000atechnological relevance understanding the solution chemistry\u000d\u000aof such metal oxido clusters on an atomic and molecular scale\u000d\u000acan open new opportunities for synthesizing nanoscale metal\u000d\u000aoxides in a controlled manner.[6, 7]\u000d\u000aWe have in recent years focused on the chemistry of\u000d\u000abismuth oxido clusters and have synthesized a range of\u000d\u000adifferently sized molecules and nanoclusters.[4a, 8] These nanoclusters are generally composed of a bismuth oxido core\u000d\u000a[BixOy]\u000d\u000az+ of varying nuclearity and charge, and anionic ligands\u000d\u000a(e.g. nitrate, carboxylates, aryl sulfonates, silanolates) for\u000d\u000acharge compensation. In the following, we will refer to the\u000d\u000astructures of the nanoclusters as [BixOy] neglecting charge\u000d\u000aand ligand shell. The nanoclusters can be considered built\u000d\u000afrom [Bi6O8] units which share edges (as defined from the\u000d\u000aoctahedra formed from Bi atoms, Figure 1A,B) to form larger\u000d\u000aclusters. These clusters represent cut-outs of the fluorite-type\u000d\u000astructure which constitutes the basis of d- and b-Bi2O3.\u000d\u000a[6, 9] For\u000d\u000aexample, the [Bi22O26] cluster[8e] (Figure 1 C) is composed of 6\u000d\u000aof these basic motifs and the [Bi38O45] cluster[4a] (Figure 1D)\u000d\u000aof 13. Similar structures are seen in metal oxido clusters of\u000d\u000aother large cations such as [Ce22O24],[10] [Ce38O54],[3a]\u000d\u000a[U38O56],[11] and [Pu38O56].[12] The [M6Ox] building block,\u000d\u000awhere M is a metal, is therefore anticipated to play an\u000d\u000aimportant role in the cluster growth, however, an understanding of the mechanisms controlling this process in\u000d\u000asolution is still missing. In situ investigations have shed light\u000d\u000aon cluster reactions in solution, and the cluster growth from\u000d\u000a[Bi6O8] to [Bi38O45] has previously been investigated with\u000d\u000aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).[13] A\u000d\u000avariety of bismuth oxido clusters were observed during the\u000d\u000areaction, but [Bi6O8], [Bi22O27] and [Bi38O45] clusters were\u000d\u000a[*] A.

The structures of the clusters shown\u000d\u000ain Figure 1 have all been determined from single crystal X-ray\u000d\u000adiffraction studies. However, characterizing cluster structures\u000d\u000adirectly in solution, as is needed for in situ studies, is more\u000d\u000achallenging. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure\u000d\u000a(EXAFS) has been used to characterize the atomic structure\u000d\u000aof some small clusters[14a, 16] and limited structural information\u000d\u000acan be obtained from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\u000d\u000aspectroscopy.[16b] However, these methods only provide\u000d\u000ainformation on the very local atomic range. Here, we use in\u000d\u000asitu X-ray total scattering (TS) and pair distribution function\u000d\u000aanalysis[17] (PDF) to follow the formation of [Bi38O45] from\u000d\u000a[Bi6O8] as a model reaction for nanocluster formation and\u000d\u000agrowth. As the Fourier transform of the TS signal, the PDF\u000d\u000arepresents a histogram of all interatomic distances in a sample,\u000d\u000aand thus provide atomic structural information from the local\u000d\u000ato the global range. PDF is an excellent technique for in situ\u000d\u000astudies of materials formation in solution,[18] and has been\u000d\u000aapplied to study a few large cluster systems previously[12a 16b] in\u000d\u000aorder to characterize their solution structure, but not in situ to\u000d\u000afollow cluster reactions. While PDF analysis offers information on the atomic structure of matter, it is less sensitive to for\u000d\u000aexample, cluster or particle size and shape. A way to\u000d\u000acomplement the structural information available in the PDF\u000d\u000ais to combine the technique with small-angle X-ray scattering\u000d\u000a(SAXS), which provides information on the size, morphology\u000d\u000aand size dispersion of clusters or particles.[19]\u000d\u000aWe here use PDF and SAXS to study the formation of the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] cluster starting from [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O[8a]\u000d\u000ain dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and obtain detailed information on the reaction pathway from octahedral [Bi6O8] units to\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] nanoclusters. To analyze the data, we have developed an automated modeling approach[20] to identify intermediates and the reaction pathway. This automated approach,\u000d\u000awhere all relevant smaller cluster structures, based on the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] framework, is tested against the experimental PDF,\u000d\u000aallows us to readily identify the size and structure evolution\u000d\u000aduring the reaction. Our results clearly identify [Bi22Oy] as\u000d\u000aa metastable intermediate structure in the reaction, and we do\u000d\u000anot observe [Bi6O8] units as a reaction intermediate on the\u000d\u000atime scale of our experiments. We also demonstrate how PDF\u000d\u000acan be used to characterize restructuring effects of the solvent\u000d\u000aat the surface of nanoclusters and show that the cluster\u2013\u000d\u000asolvent interaction affects the [Bi38O45] clusters themselves, as\u000d\u000ait introduces disorder in their structure. This effect is highly\u000d\u000adependent on the presence and type of the ligand covering the\u000d\u000aclusters. The methods and modeling tools developed here,\u000d\u000ausing automated and combined SAXS and PDF analysis thus\u000d\u000aprovides insights into cluster chemistry in solution.\u000d\u000aResults and Discussion\u000d\u000aFigure 2A shows in situ X-ray total scattering data\u000d\u000aobtained during the formation of [Bi38O45] from\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O dissolved in DMSO. The experiment was done at T= 80 8C, and data sets obtained from\u000d\u000asimilar experiments performed at lower temperatures (T=\u000d\u000a308C\u2013608C) can be found in Figure S1. At the beginning of\u000d\u000athe reaction, Bragg peaks from the crystalline\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O phase (Figure 2D) is seen, as\u000d\u000acrystals at this point are still in suspension in DMSO. After\u000d\u000aapproximately 7 min, the crystals have fully dissolved, and\u000d\u000aonly diffuse scattering is seen. We therefore turn to PDF for\u000d\u000afurther structural analysis, and the corresponding PDFs are\u000d\u000aplotted in Figure 2 B. The PDFs are the Fourier transformation of the TS data, where the signal from DMSO has been\u000d\u000asubtracted, as illustrated in Figure S2. In the beginning of the\u000d\u000aexperiment (Figure 2 E), the PDF shows the presence of longrange order from the crystalline starting material, and as\u000d\u000aexpected, the data can be fitted with the\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O structure. Towards the end of\u000d\u000athe experiments the long-range order disappears,\u000d\u000aand the PDFs now show peaks up to only about 12 !.\u000d\u000aFigure 1.

The\u000d\u000amodeling (described in detail in Table S1) was set up so that\u000d\u000athe basic atomic structure was kept fixed during the refinement. The excellent fit illustrates that the structure of the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] cluster in solution is similar (if not identical) to that\u000d\u000aseen in the crystalline phase, as also confirmed from DLS\u000d\u000ameasurements (see Figure S3).\u000d\u000aThe presence of the [Bi38O45] cluster at the end of the\u000d\u000aexperiment is further supported by SAXS experiments.\u000d\u000aIn situ SAXS data from a similar experiment are shown\u000d\u000ain Figure 2 C. Bragg peaks from the crystalline\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O phase can again be identified at\u000d\u000athe beginning of the reaction (Figure 2 C) but disappear after\u000d\u000aapproximately 10 min.

This indicates that the small [Bi6O8] clusters are not stable in DMSO\u000d\u000aon the time scales and experimental conditions of the in situ\u000d\u000aX-ray scattering experiments. This observation is confirmed\u000d\u000aby SAXS (Figure 3 B), where isolated, monodisperse [Bi6O8]\u000d\u000aclusters are not seen at any point in our data. We also do not\u000d\u000aobserve the presence of for example, [Bi10O14] structures (two\u000d\u000aedge-sharing [Bi6O8] units) or any smaller fragments. While\u000d\u000awe cannot rule out that such structures are present in very\u000d\u000asmall concentrations in the samples, they are not main species.\u000d\u000a[Bi6O8] was observed as a very dominant species in in situ\u000d\u000aESI-MS experiments.[13] However, the conditions used for the\u000d\u000aESI-MS measurements were different from the current\u000d\u000ascattering studies, as the hydrolysis reactions in the ESI-MS\u000d\u000aexperiments were followed at room temperature, at much\u000d\u000alower Bi concentration (0.05 mM\u20131 mM for ESI-MS vs.\u000d\u000a230 mM for PDF/SAXS), and in a different solvent, namely\u000d\u000aa mixture of DMSO and dichloromethane, CH2Cl2. These\u000d\u000ahighly different conditions may explain the differences in the\u000d\u000aspecies observed. However, ESI-MS is also more sensitive to\u000d\u000aminor species than both PDF and SAXS, although they will\u000d\u000aonly be detected if they can easily be charged. The two\u000d\u000aexperiments are thus not in contradiction but provide\u000d\u000ainformation for different conditions and different time scales:\u000d\u000aWhile the ESI-MS studies show that [Bi6O8] species form\u000d\u000arapidly after dissolution, their absence from our in situ X-ray\u000d\u000ascattering data indicate very low solubility and thus low\u000d\u000aconcentration of these species and fast condensation after\u000d\u000adissolution in DMSO. Both experiments show the formation\u000d\u000aof [Bi22O26] clusters as quite stable intermediate and [Bi38O45]\u000d\u000aas final products.\u000d\u000aWe can now analyze the structure of the intermediate\u000d\u000aspecies. From the similar PDF peak positions between the\u000d\u000aintermediate structure (t = 8 min) and the final cluster (t =\u000d\u000a70 min) seen in Figure 3A, it is evident that the intermediate\u000d\u000ais structurally related to the [Bi38O45] cluster, as many of the\u000d\u000amain peaks show up in both PDFs. However, the peaks\u000d\u000arepresenting the largest interatomic distances are not present\u000d\u000ain the PDF from the intermediate cluster, which also appears\u000d\u000ato be significantly more disordered, as seen from the\u000d\u000aasymmetric broadening of the first Bi\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Bi peak at r= 3.8 !\u000d\u000ain Figure 3D. Figure 3 C shows a fit of the [Bi38O45] structure\u000d\u000ato the PDF from the intermediate cluster. In Figure 3 E, the\u000d\u000aSAXS fit of the [Bi38O45] cluster to data representing the\u000d\u000aintermediate confirm that the cluster is smaller than the final\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45].\u000d\u000aTo characterize the cluster size evolution during the\u000d\u000areaction, we first analyze the in situ SAXS data with a form\u000d\u000afactor analysis. Details on the modeling and examples of fits\u000d\u000aare given in Table S3 and Figure S4. The results (Figures S5\u000d\u000aand S6) show that the average cluster size increases during the\u000d\u000areaction, and the clusters present are of a higher size\u000d\u000adispersity at the beginning of the reaction than at the end,\u000d\u000awhere the presence of stable [Bi38O45] clusters results in a very\u000d\u000alow size dispersity.\u000d\u000aThe observation that the intermediate cluster is smaller\u000d\u000abut structurally close to the [Bi38O45] structure agrees well\u000d\u000awith the chemistry of bismuth oxido clusters discussed above,\u000d\u000aas several different sizes of bismuth oxido clusters, all built up\u000d\u000afrom [Bi6O8] units can be synthesized. We therefore attempted to fit other known cluster structures, with sizes between\u000d\u000a[Bi6O8] to [Bi38O45], to the intermediate PDF as shown in\u000d\u000aFigure S7. The best cluster candidates were the [Bi18O36] and\u000d\u000a[Bi22O38] structures, agreeing well with observations from in\u000d\u000asitu ESI-MS analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and\u000d\u000aquantum chemical calculations.[13, 15a,b] However, to look\u000d\u000afurther into the time-dependent structural changes, and to\u000d\u000aprobe a larger structural space, we developed an automated\u000d\u000amethod, where all smaller cluster structures based on the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] framework were tested against the experimental\u000d\u000aPDF. Automated modeling methods for PDF analysis have\u000d\u000arecently been proposed by Banerjee et al.[21] for analysis of\u000d\u000ametal nanoparticles. In a recent study, we developed a method, where structural motifs in molybdenum oxide structures\u000d\u000awere identified by fitting automatically generated fragments\u000d\u000aof know polyoxometalate structures to PDFs.[20] We here\u000d\u000aapply an extension of this latter method to in situ data in order\u000d\u000ato identify intermediates and reaction pathways.\u000d\u000aThe principle is illustrated in Figure 4. First, the [Bi38O45]\u000d\u000amodel is fit to the PDF obtained from the last frame in the\u000d\u000aexperimental series. It was thereafter tested whether a smaller\u000d\u000aversion of the structure, i.e., with some Bi and O atoms\u000d\u000aremoved would result in a better fit to the data, as described\u000d\u000ain more detail in the Supporting Information, section I.\u000d\u000aThis method can give us an overview of the best fitting\u000d\u000astructure (built up from edge-sharing [Bi6O8] units) for every\u000d\u000aframe obtained during the reaction. Figure 5A\u2013C shows the\u000d\u000aresults from the automated modeling described above, where\u000d\u000athe refined number of Bi atoms is plotted as a function of time\u000d\u000afor the in situ experiments done at T= 808C, 60 8C, and 30 8C.\u000d\u000aResults from experiments done at other temperatures are\u000d\u000agiven in Figure S8. Figure 5A\u2013C firstly show that larger\u000d\u000astructures appear to be stabilized at higher reaction temperatures, and that the clusters grow with time. In Figure 5A (T=\u000d\u000a808C) plateaus at approximately 32 Bi atoms and 28 Bi atoms\u000d\u000aare identified, labelled as I and II. The same plateau at 28 Bi\u000d\u000aatoms is seen for the data obtained at T= 608C (Figure 5 B),\u000d\u000awhereas data from T= 30 8C (Figure 5 C) show plateaus at 25\u000d\u000aand 20 Bi atoms (III and IV). The occurrence of clusters of\u000d\u000aa given size is illustrated in Figure 5D, which shows a histogram of the cluster structures identified in all three datasets.\u000d\u000aThis shows that a large proportion of the identified clusters\u000d\u000ahave between 20 and 25 Bi atoms. In Figure 6 E\u2013H, we show\u000d\u000athe structures I\u2013IV along with fits to selected data. While\u000d\u000athese structures fit the data well, they appear unphysical, as\u000d\u000a\u201cdangling\u201d Bi atoms are seen. However, when looking closer,\u000d\u000awe identify that they share a stable backbone of 22 Bi atoms.\u000d\u000aThis is particularly clear for cluster III and IV, as seen in\u000d\u000aFigure 6A, where the Bi positions of these are compared to\u000d\u000athe [Bi22O26] structure, and fits of the [Bi22O26] cluster to the\u000d\u000asame frames (Figure 6 B,C) are reasonable.\u000d\u000aThe results from the automated modeling thus indicate\u000d\u000athat [Bi22O26] is an important intermediate in the reaction. We\u000d\u000aalso saw other frequent sizes, such as Bi28 and Bi32. However,\u000d\u000athese structures do not appear as closed-shell, physical\u000d\u000astructures, and are unlikely to be stable.

In section K in the\u000d\u000aSupporting Information, we compare simulated SAXS data of\u000d\u000athe [Bi22O26] and [Bi38O45] clusters to data at two different\u000d\u000atime points in the reaction and compare two-phase SAXS\u000d\u000arefinements to fits using individual [Bi22O26] and [Bi38O45]\u000d\u000aclusters. Generally, the two-structure models provide similar\u000d\u000afit qualities or better.\u000d\u000aHaving established that the main species present throughout the reaction are [Bi22O26] and [Bi38O45], we can sequentially analyze the data to extract phase fractions of the two\u000d\u000aclusters as a function of time. The results from this analysis are\u000d\u000ashown in Figure 7 (see Figure S12 for results from other\u000d\u000areaction temperatures). Results from SAXS is shown in blue,\u000d\u000aand PDF in red, illustrating how the [Bi38O45] fraction\u000d\u000aincreases with function of time and temperature. Analysis of\u000d\u000aSAXS and PDF data independently show similar phase\u000d\u000afractions of the two clusters in the high temperature cases, and\u000d\u000athe amount of the [Bi38O45] cluster steadily increases. We\u000d\u000atherefore attempted a combined analysis method, that is,\u000d\u000ausing the so-called complex modeling approach.[19b\u2013d, 22] Complex modeling using SAXS and PDF analysis has been\u000d\u000aexemplified for CdS nanoparticles, where Farrow et al.[19b]\u000d\u000ashowed that by combining the two techniques, a much more\u000d\u000arobust description of particle size and shape could be\u000d\u000aobtained. Here, we have in a similar way used the program\u000d\u000aDiffpy-CMI for complex modeling of PDF and SAXS data.\u000d\u000aHowever, we have applied the Debye equation to calculate\u000d\u000athe scattering pattern in both the SAXS regime and PDF\u000d\u000aregime, as described in detail in the Supporting Information,\u000d\u000asections L and M. The results of the combined modeling are\u000d\u000ashown in green in Figure 7 and generally agree well with the\u000d\u000aindividual SAXS and PDF analysis, but with more certainty\u000d\u000aon the refined parameters as seen from the less scattered data\u000d\u000apoints.\u000d\u000aWhile the results from the experiments done at higher\u000d\u000atemperatures (T= 508C\u201380 8C) generally show clear trends\u000d\u000aand a good agreement between the SAXS and PDF results,\u000d\u000alarger discrepancies are observed for the data seen from\u000d\u000aexperiments done at lower temperatures, illustrated for T=\u000d\u000a308C in Figure 7 C. Here, the PDF results are somewhat\u000d\u000ascattered, while the SAXS refinements appear to give\u000d\u000aa clearer trend. The dispersity analysis illustrated in Figures\u000d\u000aS5 and S6 furthermore showed a larger dispersion of sizes for\u000d\u000alow temperature experiments, and it may be that small\u000d\u000afractions of other cluster structures or fragments are present\u000d\u000afor longer times during these slower reactions.\u000d\u000aThe data indicate that in none of the experiments, a full\u000d\u000areaction to [Bi38O45] takes place, as some [Bi22O26] is present\u000d\u000aat the end of the experiment. The refined fraction of the final\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] cluster is approximately 60% at the end of the in situ\u000d\u000aexperiment at T= 808C, and for the reactions done at lower\u000d\u000atemperatures, the [Bi22O26] cluster remains the majority\u000d\u000aspecies in the solution. However, PDF and SAXS data\u000d\u000acollected from samples kept up to 275 days at room temperature show excellent fits with a single phase [Bi38O45] model\u000d\u000a(Figures S16 and S18).\u000d\u000aCombined, the results from the automated PDF analysis\u000d\u000aand the complex modeling of SAXS and PDF data allow us to\u000d\u000aestablish the overall reaction route. When\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O is dissolved in DMSO, larger\u000d\u000aclusters quickly form, and we never observe free [Bi6O8] (or\u000d\u000asmaller structure fragments) in our data at a time resolution\u000d\u000aFigure 6.

The local\u000d\u000astructure changes taking place during dissolution are discussed further in the Supporting Information, section O.\u000d\u000aThe experiments discussed so far were all done from\u000d\u000a[Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O.

Nevertheless, some\u000d\u000aquestions regarding the cluster growth remain unanswered\u000d\u000afrom the current study. As discussed above, it has previously\u000d\u000abeen suggested that cluster growth takes place through\u000d\u000aoligomerization reactions involving fragments of [Bi6O8] units\u000d\u000aas key species. Our data and time resolution do not allow us to\u000d\u000aidentify these short-lived species or the specific mechanism.\u000d\u000aSeveral processes may take place in the reaction: for example,\u000d\u000aelusive, larger intermediates assembled from [Bi6O8] units\u000d\u000amay form, which could collapse or partly dissociate to result\u000d\u000ain the [Bi22O26] structure. Dissociation of [Bi6O8] fragments\u000d\u000acould also take place before oligomerization to lead stepwise\u000d\u000ato [Bi22O26] and finally to [Bi38O45]. This hypothesis is\u000d\u000asupported by ESI-MS studies of the hydrolysis of bismuth\u000d\u000acarboxylates, which revealed intermediates between Bi3- and\u000d\u000aBi13-oxido clusters. Independent analytic techniques to support their formation in solution are missing, but several single\u000d\u000acrystal X-ray structures of other polynuclear bismuth oxido\u000d\u000aclusters including at least one [Bi6O8] unit with various ligands\u000d\u000ahave been reported.[9a, 15c] The time resolution for the scattering experiments currently possible limits our insight into the\u000d\u000afast processes in solution; for example, molecular dynamic\u000d\u000asimulations have suggested that the growth from [Bi6O8] units\u000d\u000atake place on the nanosecond to microsecond time scale.[15a]\u000d\u000aIn the future, new possibilities for ultrafast, high flux X-ray\u000d\u000ascattering studies may open for studies of such processes.[23] If\u000d\u000aone could chemically stabilize a series of species formed on\u000d\u000athe way to the [Bi22O26] clusters, new insight could also be\u000d\u000aobtained.\u000d\u000aLigand Exchange: From [Bi38O45(NO3)20(DMSO)d] to\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45(OMc)24(DMSO)d]\u000d\u000aPDF analysis also allows us to study cluster\u2013solvent\u000d\u000ainteractions and any structural changes that may take place\u000d\u000aduring exchange of ligands in the clusters. Figure 8A shows\u000d\u000aPDFs obtained when heating a solution of\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45(NO3)20(DMSO)28](NO3)4\u00b74DMSO in DMSO with\u000d\u000asodium methacrylate. In this process, nitrate ligands are\u000d\u000asubstituted with methacrylate[5, 9a] making the clusters soluble\u000d\u000ain organic solvents. After 7 min of the reaction, significant\u000d\u000achanges appear. Figure 8 B shows selected PDFs obtained\u000d\u000aover the course of the reaction. At the beginning, both the\u000d\u000apeaks at r! 3.8 ! and r! 6.7 ! have shoulders which\u000d\u000adisappear through the ligand exchange, and all of the peaks\u000d\u000abecome narrower and more symmetric as the reaction\u000d\u000aprogresses.\u000d\u000aWe start by modeling the first frame of the reaction with\u000d\u000athe [Bi38O45] cluster structure, Figure 9A. While this model\u000d\u000afits all main PDF peaks, significant misfits are seen, and the\u000d\u000adifference curve is similar to an exponentially dampened\u000d\u000asinusoidal function. This behavior has previously been\u000d\u000adescribed by Zobel et al., who related it to solvent restructuring effects on the surface of nanoparticles.[24] Figure 9 B shows\u000d\u000athe fit if a dampened sinusoidal function is added to the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] model. This significantly improves the fit to the data,\u000d\u000asuggesting a strong interaction between the cluster (or its\u000d\u000aligands) and the DMSO solvent. A PDF obtained from pure\u000d\u000aDMSO is shown in Figure S19 confirming that the oscillation\u000d\u000adoes not arise from the solvent itself.\u000d\u000aAt the end of the reaction, the data (Figure 9D) is very\u000d\u000awell described by the [Bi38O45] cluster, giving a Rwp value of\u000d\u000a12.2%. Here, the exponential dampened sinusoidal does not\u000d\u000acontribute to the fit as seen in Figure 9 E. Figure 9 C (bottom)\u000d\u000ashows the Rwp values of the fits during the reaction. This\u000d\u000abehavior indicates that the structuring of the solvent dominates at the beginning of the reaction but when the ligand is\u000d\u000aexchanged to methacrylate, the effect vanishes. This is also\u000d\u000aclear when plotting the contribution of the dampened sinusoidal oscillation through the reaction, Figure 9 F.\u000d\u000aThe ligand exchange, and the solvent interactions also\u000d\u000aappear to affect the atomic structure of the bismuth oxido\u000d\u000aclusters. Figure 9 C (top) shows the refined ADPs of the Bi\u000d\u000aatoms through the reaction.

The PDFs obtained from the beginning of\u000d\u000athe reaction furthermore show highly asymmetric peaks, as\u000d\u000aseen most clearly from the shoulder peak at about 4.2 !. This\u000d\u000aasymmetry is likely to be an effect of the strong interaction\u000d\u000abetween the cluster and the DMSO solvent. Modeling details\u000d\u000aare given in Table S8,9.\u000d\u000aThe solvent restructuring in the beginning of the reaction\u000d\u000ais likely due to partial dissociation of nitrate ligands, which\u000d\u000aresults in a cationic cluster, making the coordination to\u000d\u000aDMSO strong. This can result in some distortion of the\u000d\u000a[Bi38O45] core as seen from PDF peaks asymmetry. When the\u000d\u000anitrate ligand is substituted with methacrylate, the strong\u000d\u000abonding between methacrylate and the [Bi38O45] clusters\u000d\u000ahamper the coordination of DMSO to the nanoclusters, and\u000d\u000athe effect in the PDF vanishes.

The DMSO\u000d\u000amolecules coordinate to the nanocluster through strong\u000d\u000abonding to the surface of the bismuth oxido cluster with\u000d\u000adirections perpendicular to the surface of the [Bi38O45]\u000d\u000aclusters. This results in regions with alternating low and high\u000d\u000aelectron density due to packing of solvent molecules.\u000d\u000aCollectively, this gives rise to a sinusoidal oscillation contributing to the PDF. Since the solvent effect is strongest close to\u000d\u000athe surface of the [Bi38O45] clusters and it slowly transforms\u000d\u000ainto a bulk solvent structure of DMSO, the sinusoidal\u000d\u000aoscillation exponentially decays. However, we observe solvent effects of up to r= 30 !.\u000d\u000aConclusion\u000d\u000aIn situ PDF and SAXS have been used to follow the\u000d\u000areaction from a suspension of [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]\u00b73H2O in\u000d\u000aDMSO to [Bi38O45] clusters in solution (Figure 11). The\u000d\u000astructural modeling was done using the Debye equation, and\u000d\u000awe applied combined modeling of the PDF and SAXS data.\u000d\u000aTo follow the cluster growth taking place during the reaction,\u000d\u000awe introduced an automated modeling method, where\u000d\u000aintermediate species were identified by iteratively removing\u000d\u000aatoms from the final [Bi38O45] structure. This analysis showed\u000d\u000athat starting from [Bi6O8] a [Bi22O26] intermediate very\u000d\u000aquickly forms and slowly transforms to [Bi38O45]. The\u000d\u000aformation of the [Bi22O26] structure unexpectedly proceeded\u000d\u000aimmediately after dissolution of the crystalline starting\u000d\u000amaterial, meaning that the time resolution of the X-ray\u000d\u000ascattering experiments does not allow us to identify any shortlived building blocks that may form before the larger clusters\u000d\u000aare seen. Questions regarding e.g., oligomerization reactions\u000d\u000aand cluster fragmentation thus remain open, but the combination of SAXS and PDF provided new insight into the\u000d\u000acluster growth process of bismuth oxido species including\u000d\u000ainformation on the time scale at which processes occur.\u000d\u000aWe furthermore demonstrate that due to nitrate ligand\u000d\u000adissociation, a strong interaction between DMSO and the\u000d\u000abismuth oxido clusters induce restructuring of solvent molecules around the bismuth oxido clusters.
