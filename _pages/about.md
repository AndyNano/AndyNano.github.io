I have recently been awarded a 4 000 000 DKK (~ £500 000) postdoctoral grant to pursue an academic career in the interface of materials chemistry, machine learning and robotics. Here, I am building a self-driving laboratory for controlled synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials in collaboration with Prof. Tejs Vegge and the [CAPeX center](https://capex.dtu.dk/) at Technical University of Denmark, Assoc. Prof. [Volker Deringer's group](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer) at Oxford University and Prof. [Kasper Støy's group](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/kasper-st%C3%B8y) at the IT University of Copenhagen. In 2024+2025, I am physically working from Oxford.

I obtained my PhD in materials chemistry from the [Nanostructure Group UPCH](https://nanostructure-cph.com/), University of Copenhagen, supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LD11kYAAAAJ&hl=da&oi=ao), where my main interest was to study nanoparticles and structures in solution with Total X-ray Scattering with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). I applied advanced computer modelling, in Python, to combine information of both the local order from PDF and the particle order from SAXS, which overcome problems that the methods cannot overcome individually. 
During my career, the research focus has converged towards developing machine learning (ML) methods to analyse chemical data; especially PDF & SAXS, after I met Assistant Professor [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) who I had collaborated with since 2019. I have furthermore spent 6 months during my PhD working at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory with Senior Lecturer [Keith Tobias Butler](https://mdi-group.github.io/) and the [Scientific Machine Learning Group](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Scientific-Machine-Learning.aspx) to develop an general approach to match simulated and experimental data in materials chemistry. During the last period of my PhD, I have especially focused on using generative models to analyse scattering-, and spectroscopy data.
