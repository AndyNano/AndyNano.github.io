Throughout my university career at the Nanostructure Group UPCH, I have worked with material chemistry, where my main interest has been to study nanoparticles and structures in solution with Total X-ray Scattering with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). I have applied advanced computer modelling, in Python, to combine information of both the local order from PDF and the particle order from SAXS, which overcome problems that the methods cannot overcome individually. 
During my career, the research focus has slightly converged towards developing machine learning (ML) methods to analyse chemical data; especially PDF & SAXS. I have spent 6 months during my PhD working at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory with the Scientific Machine Learning group to enrich my theoretical understanding of ML as well as expand my toolbox of ML methods.
During the last period of my PhD, I will especially focus on using generative models to analyse a range of data used to analyse chemistry as scattering-, spectroscopy- and imaging data.

* **Using X-ray scattering to study the structure of nanomaterials during reaction**:
Designing new functional materials relies on understanding the fundamental chemical reactions that govern material formation and growth. In inorganic and materials chemistry, we are still challenged in describing these processes on an atomic scale, as studies of nucleation and growth phenomena are challenging. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) enables analysis of the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and clusterâ€“solvent interactions as they take place. 
I have a range of research projects using PDF and SAXS to understand the formation mechanism of nanomaterials and I have been especially interested to create new modelling approaches of PDF and SAXS data. 

* **Using interpretable machine learning to automate the analysis of scattering data**:
While we can analytically calculate the scattering pattern from a material, we are not able to straightforwardly determine the structure from a scattering pattern. This is called the inverse problem and is the reason I have spend months of my career to analyse scattering data. We can easy the inverse problem by training machine learning (ML) based methods on large databases of structures and their calculated scattering pattern. By using interpretable ML approaches, we can learn from the ML algorithms how they determine the chemical structure from a scattering pattern and thereby understand the underlying physics and chemistry.

* **Using generative models for structure solution from pair distribution function data**:
Crystallographic methods, such as single crystal and powder diffraction, allow establishing the links between material structure and properties that are at the heart of materials development. However, other approaches for atomic-scale structure determination are needed for nanostructured materials that have limited long-range order. Over the past decades, Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis has become a core tool for analysis of nanomaterial structure. Currently, PDF analysis is mainly done by fitting a known starting model to an experimental PDF to extract quantitative structural information. However, identifying a model or solving a structure de novo, from a PDF, is still an enormous challenge. I develop generative models that can solve a simple nanoparticle structure directly from a PDF.
