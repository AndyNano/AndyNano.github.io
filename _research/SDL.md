I have recently been awarded a 4 000 000 DKK (~ £500 000) postdoctoral grant to pursue an academic career in the interface of materials chemistry, machine learning and robotics. Here, I am building a self-driving laboratory for controlled synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials.

**Collaborators:** I am collaboration with Prof. Tejs Vegge and the [CAPeX center](https://capex.dtu.dk/) at Technical University of Denmark, Assoc. Prof. [Volker Deringer's group](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer) at Oxford University and Prof. [Kasper Støy's group](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/kasper-st%C3%B8y) at the IT University of Copenhagen. In 2024+2025, I am physically working from Oxford.

**Selected papers:**
